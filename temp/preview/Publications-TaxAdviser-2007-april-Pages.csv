CSAs can help businesses operate in the global marketplace in a tax-efficient manner; however, the proposed regulations need to be carefully reviewed.<strong></strong> <br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<h3>Definition</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">CSAs, formally prescribed by regulations effective on Jan. 1, 1996 (TD 8632, 12/20/95), have become an increasingly popular vehicle for global businesses to manage development and global use of intellectual property in a tax-efficient way. Conceptually, a CSA permits two or more companies to share (1) jointly in the cost of developing intellectual property and (2) proportionally in the revenue and profits resulting from exploiting it. As a practical matter, multinational corporations use CSAs to shift some of the revenue and profits resulting from the successful exploitation of intellectual property from the U.S. to foreign tax (often, low-tax) jurisdictions. The result is lower effective tax rates and higher earnings-per-share.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">CSAs may be used in connection with various kinds of intellectual property, including manufacturing technology, processes and know-how (whether patented or not) and marketing properties (such as trademarks and tradenames). CSAs are formally recognized by many foreign tax authorities under international guidelines published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. A CSA will be respected in the U.S. only if it meets certain requirements. Among these, it must be pursuant to a written agreement and disclosed in a U.S. income tax return.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Treasury’s Concerns</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Treasury is concerned that the aggressive use of CSAs by some taxpayers has resulted in a loss of U.S. tax revenue, particularly the undervaluation of “buy-in payments.” In connection with entering into a CSA, one party (the contributor) typically contributes pre-existing intellectual property to the CSA. The other party (the payer) must pay the contributor for the value of such property, via a buy-in payment. Under Regs. Sec. 1.482-7(g), the buy-in payment is determined based on the value of the pre-existing intellectual property at the CSA’s inception. If the pre-existing intellectual property is still “on the laboratory bench,” or at least not yet proven commercially, a relatively low value is often ascribed to the payment. If the intellectual property proves to be commercially successful, the profits shifted from the U.S. to the foreign tax jurisdiction may be quite large relative to the combined buy-in payment and cost-sharing payments.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Prop. Regs.</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Treasury has introduced the “investor model,” a framework for addressing the quantitative elements of a CSA, including buy-in payments. Generally, its underlying premise is that the payer should earn no greater than a market rate of return from exploitation of the intellectual property, and that any above-market returns should be realized by the contributor. The investor model effectively limits the income that can be shifted outside the U.S. tax net by U.S. developers of technology and other intellectual property.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">As an adjunct to the investor model, buy-in payments must account for the exclusive, perpetual and territorial right to enhance and develop the contributed intangible property. This limits taxpayers’ ability to place an unreasonably low value on pre-existing contributed property, based on the premise that the rights to it are severely limited. The proposed regulations introduce a variety of new methods for valuing property contributed to a CSA.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.482-7 grants the IRS unilateral authority to make allocations to adjust the results of a CSA if they are inconsistent with arm’s-length results. Taxpayers may avoid such adjustments if the CSA results fall within a safe-harbor range of returns, generally defined as 50%–200% of a market return, and if certain administrative requirements are met. Taxpayers have limited rights to refute proposed adjustments based on facts and circumstances.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Additionally, Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.482-7(c) formalizes the Service’s position that make-sell rights must be addressed separately outside the CSA. Thus, if a taxpayer wishes to cost-share technology currently used to manufacture products and that serves as a springboard for the development of derivative technologies, it must charge a royalty for the make-sell rights outside the CSA and a separate buy-in payment for the right to develop derivative technologies within the CSA. Finally, Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.482-7(d) incorporates the IRS’s position that intangible development costs must include all costs in cash or kind, including stock-based compensation. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Effective Date</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The regulations are proposed to be effective for CSAs commencing on or after the date final regulations are published in the <em>Federal Register, </em>which is anticipated to be in 2007. CSAs in existence as of Dec. 31, 2006 remain generally subject to the 1996 regulations; however, such grandfathered CSAs may become subject to the new regulations if any of certain changes to a CSA occur, or if the taxpayer fails to comply with the transition rules.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Implications</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The proposed regulations contain provisions that give the Service broad and unilateral authority to make allocations to adjust taxpayers’ results of CSAs after the fact. Although some of the more controversial provisions will likely be revised in final regulations, CSAs may become less attractive than they are currently. Until regulations are finalized, taxpayers should consider alternative and interim strategies, including developing new intellectual property offshore under the developer-assister rules and structuring acquisitions to leave acquired intellectual property rights offshore. </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

Secs. 358 and 356 address allocation of basis to property received in a reorganization and gain recognition on receipt of boot, respectively.</p>\\r\\n<p>Proposed regulations (REG-116564-03, 5/3/04) provided a tracing method for allocating basis under Sec. 358 in Sec. 368 reorganizations and Sec. 355 distributions. Under this method, each share of stock received is traced to the share surrendered for Sec. 368 reorganizations; each share received in a Sec. 355 distribution is allocated basis from a share of stock of the distributing corporation. </p>\\r\\n<p>The preamble to the final regulations explains that the IRS and Treasury adopted the tracing method because they felt the averaging of bases of stock that may have been purchased at different times and different prices was not justified under the substituted-basis rule of Sec. 358; see TD 9244 (1/23/06). They were also concerned that averaging would not allow taxpayers to properly arrange their affairs and might create opportunities for tax avoidance. <em></em></p>\\r\\n<h3>Final Regs.</h3>\\r\\n<p>The final regulations retain the tracing method and provide that if the parties to a reorganization specify in the terms which particular share or class of stock is being exchanged for another particular share or class, and the allocation is economically reasonable, the terms of the agreement control. </p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if common stock is exchanged for common and preferred stock of another corporation or stock and boot, the terms of the agreement could specify which blocks (shares acquired at different dates or prices) were exchanged for common stock and which shares were exchanged for preferred stock or boot; see Regs. Sec. 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii). If economically reasonable, the terms would control. If the terms are not specified, a pro-rata portion of shares of each class is received in exchange for each share of stock surrendered, in accordance with the fair market value (FMV) of the stock surrendered.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Allocating boot:</em></strong> The regulations also provide rules for allocating boot received when determining gain recognition. As with qualifying consideration, boot may be allocated consistent with the rules above—i.e., if the terms specify the allocation of boot received in the exchange and the allocation is economically reasonable, it will be respected; see Regs. Sec. 1.356-1(b). If the terms do not specify, a pro-rata portion of boot is treated as received in exchange for each share surrendered, in accordance with the FMV of the stock surrendered. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Designations:</em></strong> In addition, the regulations provide that if a shareholder who receives shares in a transaction to which the regulations apply cannot identify which particular share is exchanged for which particular share, the shareholder may designate such if it is consistent with the transaction’s terms; see Regs. Sec. 1.358-2(a)(2)(vii). The designation must be made before the security is received or deemed received (or, for a transaction under Sec. 355, before the security is relevant). </p>\\r\\n<p>The final regulations do not apply to transactions to which Sec. 351 or 1036 applies, unless Sec. 354 or 356 also applies; see Regs. Sec. 1.358-2(a)(2)(viii) and (ix). </p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 1 (based on Regs. Sec. 1.358-2, </em>Example (4)):</strong><em> J,</em> an individual, acquired 10 shares of Class A stock of <em>X </em>Corp. on date 1 for $2 each, 10 shares of Class A stock of <em>X</em> on date 2 for $4 each and 20 shares of Class B stock of <em>X</em> on date 3 for $6 each. On date 4, <em>Y </em>Corp. acquired <em>X’</em>s  assets<em> </em>in an A reorganization. Under the reorganization plan’s terms, <em>J</em> surrendered all his <em>X</em> shares for 40 shares of <em>Y </em>stock and $200. On the exchange date, the FMV of each share of <em>X</em> Class A stock was $10, the FMV of each share of <em>X</em> Class B stock was $10 and the FMV of each share of <em>Y </em>stock was $5. The terms of the exchange do not specify which shares of <em>Y</em> stock or cash were received in exchange for which shares of <em>X </em>Class A or Class B stock. <strong></strong></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Because the terms of the exchange do not specify which shares are exchanged for which shares or cash, a pro-rata portion of the shares of Y stock and cash received will be treated as received in exchange for each share of X Class A and Class B stock surrendered, based on the FMV of such stock. </p>\\r\\n<p>Thus, because the FMV of class A and class B stock is the same, J is treated as receiving one share of Y stock and $5 in exchange for each share of X Class A and Class B stock. J realizes $140 gain on the exchange of shares of X Class A stock, $100 of which is recognized to the extent of boot received, under Regs. Sec. 1.356-1(a). J realizes $80 gain on the exchange of X Class B stock, all of which is recognized under Regs. Sec. 1.356-1(a). Under the regulations, J has 10 shares of Y stock, each of which has a $2 basis and is treated as having been acquired on date 1; 10 shares of Y stock, each of which has a $4 basis and is treated as having been acquired on date 2; and 20 shares of Y stock, each of which has a $5 basis and is treated as having been acquired on date 3. J may designate which of the shares of Y stock received have a $2 basis, which have a $4 basis and which have a $5 basis. J’s total realized gain on the transaction was $220; his total recognized gain was $180. </p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 2 (based on Regs. Sec. 1.358-2(c), </em>Example (5)):</strong> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except the reorganization plan’s terms specify that <em>J</em> receives 40 shares of <em>Y</em> stock in exchange for his <em>X </em>Class A stock and $200 in exchange for his <em>X</em> Class B stock. (Such terms are economically reasonable.) </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>In Example 2, J realizes $140 gain on the exchange of shares of X Class A stock, none of which is recognized under Regs. Sec. 1.356-1(a) (because stock was transferred solely for stock). J realizes $80 gain on the exchange of shares of X Class B stock, all of which is recognized under Regs. Sec. 1.356-1(a). Again, J had a total realized gain of $220, but recognized only $80. </p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 3:</em></strong> <em>T</em>, an individual, acquired 10 shares of Class A stock (the only class of stock issued and outstanding) of <em>Z </em>Corp. on date 1 for $2 each and 10 shares of Class A stock of <em>Z </em>Corp. on date 2 for $20 each. On date 3, <em>V </em>Corp. acquired <em>Z’</em>s assets in an A reorganization. Under the reorganization plan’s terms, <em>T</em> surrendered all the <em>Z</em> shares for 40 shares of <em>V</em> stock and $200. On the exchange date, the FMV of each share of <em>Z</em> Class A stock was $20, and the FMV of each share of <em>V </em>stock was $5. The plan’s terms specify that <em>T</em> receives 40 shares of <em>V</em> stock in exchange for his shares of<em> Z</em> Class A stock acquired on date 1, and $200 in exchange for his shares of <em>Z</em> Class A stock acquired on date 2. (Such terms are economically reasonable.)</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>In Example 3, T realizes $180 gain on the exchange of shares of Class A stock acquired on date 1, none of which is recognized under Regs. Sec. 1.356-1(a), because T transferred stock solely for stock, and realizes no gain on the exchange of shares of Z Class A stock acquired on date 2.</p>\\r\\n<p>In Example 3, the agreement called for a different allocation of consideration between shares of the same class of stock for which the shareholder’s basis in the respective blocks is the only difference between the shares. (This example is not included in the final regulations.) </p>\\r\\n<h3>Summary</h3>\\r\\n<p>Under the appropriate facts, the final regulations allow a taxpayer to defer gain recognition on the receipt of boot in a reorganization through allocations in the transaction agreement. However, caution is warranted, as the term “economically reasonable” has not been defined by the IRS, Treasury or the courts as to these regulations. </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClassA1290A51E7CD479C9655FA58395254CF><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>T</strong>axpayers’ widespread adoption of the limited liability company (LLC) has caused Treasury and the IRS to take a closer look at transactions using it. For example, most states’ enactment of rules allowing for mergers involving LLCs was one reason Treasury issued Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(b), to address statutory mergers involving disregarded entities. Treasury and the Service should consider whether clarification is needed for transfers to a controlled corporation under Sec. 351, as discussed in Rev. Rul. 84-111.  </p>\\r\\n<h3>Background</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 351(a) provides for tax-deferred treatment of property transfers to corporations in exchange for stock constituting control of the corporation. If Sec. 351’s requirements are met, the transferors recognize neither gain nor loss on the exchange. The transferee corporation takes a carryover basis in the property received, under Sec. 362. The transferor’s basis in the stock received is the same as its basis for the property transferred, according to Sec. 358; see Sec. 351(h)(2).</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 351(b) requires gain, but not loss, recognition when the transferor receives property other than stock in the controlled corporation. The transferor recognizes gain of the lesser of the gain realized or the fair market value of nonqualifying property received. The character of the gain recognized depends on the character of the property transferred to the corporation; see Rev. Rul. 60-302.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The Code does not define “property” for Sec. 351 purposes, but the courts have broadly interpreted the term. In <em>Hempt Bros., Inc.,</em> 354 FSupp 1172 (MD PA 1973), the court held that “the term encompasses whatever may be transferred.” An interest in a partnership or an LLC (taxed as a partnership) transferred to a corporation is also property for Sec. 351 purposes; see Rev. Ruls. 81-38 (transferring less than all interests) and 84-111 (transferring all interests).</p>\\r\\n<h3>Application of Rev. Rul. 84-111</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Rev. Rul. 84-111 provides guidance for Sec. 351 transfers of 100% of the interests of a partnership under subchapter K. It offers the following three methods for determining the treatment of the transfers, and holds that the form of the transfer controls the treatment:</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">1. <em>Assets over:</em> a transfer by a partnership (or an LLC) of assets to the corporation in exchange for consideration, followed by the liquidation of the partnership (or LLC) via the distribution of the consideration.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">2. <em>Interests over:</em> a transfer of the partnership (or LLC) interests by the partners (or members) to the corporation in exchange for consideration.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">3. <em>Assets up and over:</em> a distribution of all partnership (or LLC) assets to the partners (or members) in liquidation, followed by a contribution of the assets received to the corporation, in exchange for consideration.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Assets over:</em></strong> The specific tax treatment of each transfer differs. With the assets-over form, the transferee corporation takes a basis in the assets received under Sec. 362; the transferor partnership takes a basis in the transferee stock received equal to the basis in the assets transferred, reduced by liabilities, under Sec. 358. On liquidation of the transferor partnership, the partners take a basis in the transferee stock received equal to their bases in their partnership interests, under Sec. 732(b). </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Interests over:</em></strong> In the interests-over form, the transferee corporation’s basis in the assets received on the partnership’s termination is determined under Sec. 732(c) and equals the transferors’ bases in their partnership interests transferred, while the transferor partners take a basis in the transferee stock equal to their bases in the partnership interests transferred. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Asstes up and over:</em></strong> In the assets-up-and-over form, the partners take a basis in the assets distributed to them under Sec. 732(b) equal to their respective bases in the partnership; the transferee corporation takes a basis in the assets received under Sec. 362(a) equal to the transferors’ bases in the assets transferred. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">An important distinction occurs in the assets-over transfer; the partnership, not each partner, is the transferor. Thus, to the extent gain is recognized under Sec. 351(b) on the receipt of cash or other property, the partnership recognizes the gain; a partner receiving only stock consideration on liquidation could recognize gain on the partnership’s receipt of cash or other property. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Other methods:</em></strong> In addition to the three methods prescribed in Rev. Rul. 84-111, two additional methods could apply to the incorporation of a partnership. The first is a “formless” incorporation, in which the partnership incorporates via a check-the-box election under Regs. Sec. 301.7701-3(g)(1)(i) or a state law formless conversion. This is an assets-over transfer; see Rev. Rul. 2004-59. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The second situation could exist when the transfer occurs via a merger involving the partnership and corporation (or a transitory disregarded entity of the corporation). The IRS and Treasury have yet to provide formal guidance on this issue; in fact, it is unclear whether such a merger even represents a situation separate from the three described in Rev. Rul. 84-111.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Additional Guidance Needed</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">However, by applying existing partnership rules and rules similar to those in the corporate context, transfers involving partnership mergers should fit within one of the three methods. In the corporate context, a merger’s effect depends on its direction. For example, a forward subsidiary merger, in which the target’s legal existence ceases, represents an asset transfer by the target, followed by its liquidation; see Rev. Rul. 69-6. However, in a reverse subsidiary merger involving a transitory subsidiary formed solely to perform the merger, the application of step-transaction principles casts the merger as the direct transfer of target stock, disregarding the subsidiary’s existence as transitory; see, e.g., Rev. Ruls. 90-95, 67-448, 73-427, 74-564 and 79-273. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Legal existence critical:</em></strong> Recently finalized corporate reorganization regulations support the fact that, despite being disregarded for Federal tax purposes, the legal entity’s existence is important in determining the reorganization’s substance; see Regs. Sec. 1.368-2. For example, according to Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(b)(1)(iii), <em>Example (2), </em>the merger of a target with and into a disregarded entity of a purchaser could qualify as an A reorganization. However, if the target remains in existence as a disregarded entity, a statutory merger has not occurred, because it “continues to exist as a juridical entity,” albeit as a disregarded one; see Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(b)(iii), <em>Example (9).</em></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Rev. Rul. 84-111 can be applied to mergers in the context of the incorporation of a partnership. In the case of both a forward and reverse partnership merger with a disregarded entity of a corporation, the partnership terminates and goes out of existence for Federal tax purposes; see Sec. 708(b)(1)(A). However, Rev. Rul. 84-111 holds that form controls treatment; thus, it is important to determine if the two mergers are distinguishable and how the substance-over-form doctrine applies in the context of that ruling. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A forward merger in which the target partnership’s legal existence ceases likely represents an assets-over transfer in which the partnership transfers assets to the corporation in exchange for consideration, followed by the liquidation of the partnership through distribution of the consideration. The IRS has so ruled in similar situations in which partnerships merged into a corporation or its disregarded entity; see IRS Letter Rulings 9915030 and 9409035. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">However, in the case of a reverse merger involving a transitory disregarded entity, the facts are clearly distinguishable from the letter rulings cited; the transfer likely represents an interests-over transfer in which the partners transferred their partnership interests to the corporation in exchange for consideration, even though the partnership terminated under Sec. 708(b)(1)(A). In a similar situation, the Service, citing Rev. Ruls. 73-427 and 79-273, ruled that the transitory existence of a partnership is disregarded in determining that a merger involving a disregarded entity represented an acquisition of the target partnership interests; see Letter Ruling 9148041. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">It seems clear that the transitory existence of a disregarded acquisition LLC should be disregarded, and the merger should represent the direct transfer of the LLC interests. This view is further supported by regulations, case law and formal IRS guidance. Regs. Sec. 1.741-1(b) states that the sale of all partnership interests to one or more parties outside the partnership, is a sale of partnership interests, not partnership assets. In addition, <em>McCauslen, </em>45 TC 588 (1966), held that the acquisition by one partner of another partner’s interest represented a sale of the partner’s interest, despite the fact that the partnership terminated as a result of the acquisition.  </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>McCauslen:</strong> The primary issue addressed in <em>McCauslen</em> was the treatment of the acquirer of the partnership interest, because the acquisition resulted in the partnership’s termination as a result of the acquirer becoming the sole owner. The court acknowledged that the tax ramifications of a transaction may differ, greatly depending on its form. Because the acquisition of the interest resulted in the partnership’s termination under Sec. 708(b)(1)(A), it was an acquisition of the underlying assets, not the partnership interests. The seller’s treatment was not an issue; however, the court’s analysis confirmed that Sec. 741 applied to the selling partner’s sale of the interest. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Partnership mergers:</em></strong> The partnership merger regulations under Sec. 708 provide a useful analysis of the importance of form within partnership mergers as well. Under Regs. Sec. 1.708-1(c)(4), if a partner sells an interest in a merging partnership via the assets-over form, the sale of the interest is respected if the partner and partnership consent to treat it as the sale of an interest. While the regulation applies to partnership mergers in which the partnership survives, it clearly shows the importance of and respect for the intended tax consequences to the parties, and adopts the availability of the interests-over method of Rev. Rul. 84-111. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>LLCs:</em></strong> As to the acquisition of target LLC interests in which the target LLC remains in existence, the Service has held that the sale of LLC interests by the members to an outside party represents the sale of those interests under Sec. 741; see Rev. Rul. 99-6, which cites Rev. Rul. 84-111, situation 3 (interests over), in determining the appropriate treatment. Thus, if the reverse merger represents the acquisition of LLC interests, it should be an interests-over transfer under Rev. Rul. 84-111. Neither Rev. Rul. 99-6 nor 84-111 addresses the method of acquisition of the entity interest; thus, there seems to be no reason that a reverse merger, in which the transitory existence of the acquisition entity is disregarded under appropriate step-transaction principles, should not qualify as a direct acquisition of the interests in a target LLC.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Existing authority appears to support strongly the position that an (otherwise qualifying) transfer, accomplished by reverse merger of an LLC with a transitory disregarded entity of a corporation with the LLC surviving, represents an interests-over transfer. However, Treasury and the IRS should consider updating formal guidance to bring the analysis of Rev. Rul. 84-111 up-to-date with today’s business realities.</p>\\r\\n</div>

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClass5217249864774389B88636817774F534><div class=ExternalClass5E01BF154A96461DA864EE06EE53831B>\\r\\n<p><strong>I</strong>n yet another in a series of F reorganization rulings, the IRS issued Letter Ruling 200701017, holding that the formation of a new corporation, followed by the contribution of S stock and an immediate qualified subchapter S subsidiary (QSub) election, will be treated as an F reorganization (i.e., a mere change in identity, form or place of organization under Sec. 368(a)(1)(F)). The new corporation was created so that the existing one could distribute assets up to the new holding company to protect them from the existing corporation’s potential liabilities. A mere distribution of the assets would have exceeded the accumulated adjustments account and created a taxable distribution of C corporation earnings and profits and, potentially, Sec. 311(b) gain.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Definition</h3>\\r\\n<p>Under Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(m)(1)(i), a mere change occurs if, as a result of a transaction or series of transactions:</p>\\r\\n<p>1. All the stock of the resulting corporation, including stock issued before the transfer, is issued in respect of the transferring corporation’s stock. </p>\\r\\n<p>2. There is no change in the corporation’s ownership in the transaction, except a change that has no effect other than that of a redemption of less than all of the corporation’s shares. </p>\\r\\n<p>3. The transferring corporation completely liquidates in the transaction. </p>\\r\\n<p>4. The resulting corporation does not hold any property or have any tax attributes (including those specified in Sec. 381(c)) immediately before the transfer. </p>\\r\\n<p>Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(m)(1)(ii)(A) allows an exception to the third item above, in that the transferring corporation is not required to legally dissolve. However, the regulation remains in proposed form; Treasury continues to examine the appropriate definition of a “mere change.” </p>\\r\\n<h3>Application of Step-Transaction Doctrine</h3>\\r\\n<p>Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(m)(3)(i) also adopts historical application of the step-transaction doctrine to F reorganizations, treating a series of related transactions that together result in a mere change as an F reorganization. Further, the fact that an F reorganization occurs within a larger transaction that results in more than a mere change will not cause failure of the otherwise qualifying F reorganization; see Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(m)(3)(ii). Precedent for this application is found in Rev. Ruls. 2003-48, 96-29, 79-250, 69-516 and 61-156. </p>\\r\\n<p>These rulings generally discuss application of the step-transaction doctrine to the continuity-of-interest (COI)<strong> </strong>requirement. In Rev. Rul. 69-516, the Service respected an F reorganization that represented a step in a series of transactions that ultimately resulted in a C reorganization. This ruling is significant, as application of the step-transaction doctrine could have collapsed the entire transaction into a C reorganization; however, the IRS did not rule that the step-transaction doctrine should ignore the F reorganization. In Rev. Rul. 79-250, the Service held that application of the step-transaction doctrine should not cause an F reorganization to fail when it is part of a series of transactions in a larger transaction. Rev. Rul. 96-29 ruled on identical facts as found in Rev. Rul. 79-250; however, in addition to ruling similarly on the facts, it emphasized the unique application of the step-transaction doctrine to F reorganizations. The courts have ruled similarly on the applicability of the step-transaction doctrine to F reorganizations, ruling that such a reorganization is functionally unrelated to other simultaneous or almost-simultaneous transactions; see<em> Reef Corp.,</em> 368 F2d 125 (5th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. </em>den.; <em>Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.,</em> 568 F2d 811 (2d Cir. 1976); and <em>Casco Products Corp., </em>49 TC 32 (1967).</p>\\r\\n<h3>QSub Regs.</h3>\\r\\n<p>Promulgation of the QSub regulations added yet another wrinkle. The preamble states that “the final regulations provide that general principles of tax law, including step transaction, apply to determine the tax consequences of the transactions that include a QSub election”; see TD 8869, 1/21/00. While Treasury did not include an example of a QSub election in conjunction with an F reorganization in the final regulations, it clearly intended the contribution of S stock to a new S corporation to qualify as an F reorganization. Preamble Section 2, “F” Reorganizations During the Transition Period, provides that:  </p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>…formation of a new shell S corporation (Newco) by the shareholders of an existing S corporation, followed by the contribution of the stock of the existing S corporation to Newco, coupled with an immediate QSub election for the existing corporation, should be characterized as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F) if all of the other requisites of that section are met.  </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Regs. Sec. 1.1361-4(a)(5) established a transition period, applicable for QSub elections before 2001, during which the step-transaction doctrine would not apply. However, Treasury concluded in Section 2 that the transition rules were intended to offer relief for taxpayers during this transition period; thus, the step-transaction doctrine continued to apply to F reorganizations, as the result was generally considered taxpayer-favorable.</p>\\r\\n<p>Why does it matter? If the transaction was not an F reorganization, would it not qualify as a D reorganization (see Regs. Sec. 1.1361-4(a)(2)(ii), <em>Example (3))?</em> If the transaction meets the requirements of both an F and a D reorganization, the F reorganization prevails; see Rev. Rul. 57-276. In that ruling, the holding company was deemed a continuation of the QSub, and the tax year of the S corporation continued; see also Rev. Rul. 64-250. In addition, any existing QSub elections do not terminate; see Rev. Rul. 2004-85. There is also some question as to whether built-in gains tax recognition under Sec. 1374 is restarted following a D reorganization.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Pre- and Post-Reorganization Transactions</h3>\\r\\n<p>While not addressed in Letter Ruling 200701017, qualification as an F reorganization could also be important for pre- and post-reorganization transactions. Neither the COI nor the continuity-of-business-enterprise requirements apply to an F reorganization; see Regs. Sec. 1.368-1(b). Prop. Regs. Sec. 1.368-2(m)(5) shows one such application of this provision in <em>Example (6),</em> in which, immediately following the F reorganization, all of the corporation’s stock is sold; however, the sale does not prevent qualification of the F reorganization. Applying this theory to an S holding company, an F reorganization could provide a number of planning opportunities. </p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> An S corporation target, <em>X </em>Corp., holds not only business assets, but also highly appreciated nonbusiness assets (or unwanted business assets of another division) that it does not intend to sell. Acquirer <em>Y</em> Corp. not only wants a basis step-up in the acquired assets, but also must acquire the <em>X</em> stock to retain certain valuable <em>X </em>contracts and licenses. The common answer to <em>Y’</em>s dilemma is the use of Sec. 338(h)(10). However, in this situation, the Sec. 338(h)(10) transaction will generate significant gain under Sec. 331 on the distribution of the highly appreciated unwanted assets. Could an F reorganization be the answer?  </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Prior to consummating the acquisition, X<em> </em>implements a holding-company structure and QSub election, becoming a disregarded QSub. At this point, this is a valid F reorganization. If X<em> </em>then distributes the highly appreciated unwanted assets to the holding company, Z, the distribution should be a nonevent for Federal tax purposes. </p>\\r\\n<p>Following the distribution, Y purchases the QSub stock from Z. This acquisition should be treated as Z’s sale of the QSub’s assets to Y, followed by Y’s contribution of the assets to the target (a newly formed corporation for Federal tax purposes); see Regs. Sec. 1.1361-5(b)(3), <em>Example (9).</em> </p>\\r\\n<p>The result to Y is no different from an acquisition with a Sec. 338(h)(10) election; however, X avoided gain recognition on the highly appreciated unwanted assets. Does this series of transactions represent an F reorganization, followed by a separately respected sale of assets? If a good corporate business purpose is established, it would appear that it does.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p>In summary, the interplay of the F reorganization and the disregarded-entity provisions provides numerous planning opportunities to well-informed taxpayers and tax advisers. However, Treasury continues to study the definition of a “mere change”; a letter ruling request remains advisable for taxpayers looking for certainty. </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

While much has been written about this topic,<sup><a href=\"#2\">2</a></sup> not much has been written about the aftermath of capitalization—i.e., once the cost of an intangible asset has been capitalized, how is that cost recovered? This two-part article:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Summarizes the new Sec. 263(a) regulations (as discussed below, otherwise known as the “<em>INDOPCO</em> regulations”); </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Examines cost recovery possibilities, including, among other authority, Sec. 197 (amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles) and Sec. 167 (other intangibles); and </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Examines how the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations affect the treatment of certain start-up costs under Sec. 195. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>Part I, below, summarizes the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, Sec. 197 cost recovery and general Sec. 167 amortization rules. Part II, in the May 2007 issue, will focus on the income-forecast method, lease acquisitions, options, computer software, and transaction and business acquisition costs.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Background</h3>\\r\\n<p>In general, expenditures are deducted currently (expensed), capitalized and deducted over time or capitalized with no deduction. Under Sec. 162(a), expenditures are deducted currently if they are ordinary and necessary business expenses. Under Regs. Sec. 1.263(a)-2(a), expenditures are capitalized if they result in benefits that extend substantially beyond the end of the tax year. Under Regs. Sec. 1.263(a)-1(b), expenditures are capitalized if they result in permanent improvements or better­ments, including materially increasing value, appreciably prolonging useful life or adapting an asset to a new or different use. </p>\\r\\n<p>In 1992, the Supreme Court held in <em>INDOPCO</em><sup><a href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> that expenditures should be capitalized if they result in significant future benefits, whether or not they produce a separate and distinct asset. Unfortunately, the significant-future-benefits test raised more questions than it answered.</p>\\r\\n<p>To clarify matters with regard to intangible assets, the IRS issued Regs. Sec. 1.263(a)-4 (acquiring or creating intangibles) and Regs. Sec. 1.263(a)-5 (facilitating the acquisition, restructuring or reorganization of a business). These regulations, commonly called the “<em>INDOPCO</em> regulations,” are effective for intangible asset costs paid or incurred after 2003. They are intended to provide bright-line rules<sup><a href=\"#4\">4</a></sup> to make the <em>INDOPCO</em>-standards-based approach (significant future benefits) for capitalization more administrable.</p>\\r\\n<h3><em>INDOPCO</em> Regs.</h3>\\r\\n<p>The <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations<sup><a href=\"#5\">5</a></sup> require capitalization of six categories<sup><a href=\"#6\">6</a></sup> of expenditures relating to intangible assets; they are numbered and summarized in the <a href=\"/Publications/TaxAdviser/2007/april/PublishingImages/exhibit.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">exhibit</a>. Of these six categories, four pertain to direct costs and two pertain to indirect costs (otherwise known as “transaction costs”). In this article, reference is made, for example, to “category 1, 2, 3 or 4 intangible assets” and “category 5 or 6 transaction costs.”</p>\\r\\n<p>Regs. Sec. 1.263(a)-4(b)(4) provides that the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations do not affect the treatment of amounts specifically provided for in Code sections (and regulations thereunder) other than Sec. 162 (ordinary and necessary business expenses) or 212 (expenses of producing income). For instance, the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations do not apply to research and development costs, because Sec. 174 specifically applies.</p>\\r\\n<p>If an expenditure does not fall into one of the six categories, or is not identified in subsequently published guidance, capitalizing is not required, and deducting is allowed.<sup><a href=\"#7\">7</a></sup> In other words, under the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, listed categories of expenditures are to be capitalized; everything else is to be deducted. While this approach seems harmless, it reverses well-established principles. Before the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, capitalizing was the norm; deducting was the exception. After the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, at least with regard to intangible assets, deducting is the norm; capitalizing is the exception.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Cost Recovery (Amortization) in General</h3>\\r\\n<p>The <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations are capitalization provisions, not cost recovery provisions. For the latter, taxpayers should refer to:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 197 (15-year amortization); </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 167,<sup><a href=\"#8\">8</a></sup> in which the cost of an intangible asset is: </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <ol>\\r\\n        <li>\\r\\n        <p>Amortized over the asset’s useful life;<sup><a href=\"#9\">9</a></sup> </p>\\r\\n        </li>\\r\\n        <li>\\r\\n        <p>Amortized over 15 years (safe harbor); </p>\\r\\n        </li>\\r\\n        <li>\\r\\n        <p>Not amortized; or </p>\\r\\n        </li>\\r\\n        <li>\\r\\n        <p>In some cases, amortized using the units-of-production method or the income-forecast method. </p>\\r\\n        </li>\\r\\n    </ol>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 178 (lease acquisition costs); and </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 1234 (options). </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>Sec. 197 Amortization</h3>\\r\\n<p>For “amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles,” Sec. 197(a) allows amortization over 15 years (180 months), on a straight-line basis, with no salvage value, beginning in the month when such intangible assets are acquired. As described more fully below:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Some intangibles qualify as amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles only if obtained as part of acquiring a business; </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Others qualify even though obtained separately; </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Some intangible assets qualify only if purchased; and </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Others qualify even though self-created. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Business-Acquisition Amortizable Sec. 197 Intangibles</h5>\\r\\n<p>The following intangible assets are amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles only if they are obtained as part of acquiring a business: goodwill, going-concern value, workforce in place, information base and know-how (including copyrights and patents), customer-based intangibles, supplier-based intangibles, interests in films, sound recordings, videotapes or books, and covenants not to compete.</p>\\r\\n<p>Under Regs. Sec. 1.197-2(b)(4), “information base” includes, among other things, business books and records, technical manuals, training manuals and lists of current or prospective customers, subscribers and advertisers. Under Regs. Sec. 1.197-2(b)(5), “know-how” includes formulas, processes, designs, copyrights and patents. A “covenant not to compete” is a contract between, in general, a seller and a buyer, under which the seller agrees not to compete with the buyer for a certain period within a certain geographic area.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 1—goodwill:</em></strong> On April 1 of year 1, <em>X</em> Co. purchased all of the assets of <em>Q</em> Co., and paid $300,000 for goodwill.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Pursuant to the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>X</em> must capitalize the $300,000, because the goodwill is a category 1 intangible asset. It is an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible, because it is goodwill obtained as part of acquiring a business. For year 1, <em>X’</em>s amortization deduction for goodwill would be $15,000 (($300,000/180 (months in 15 years)) × 9 (months in year 1)).</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 2—customer lists:</em></strong> In year 1, <em>Y</em> Co. spent $60,000 to internally develop customer list #1. In the same year, <em>Y</em> purchased all of the assets of <em>R</em> Co., and paid $90,000 for customer list #2.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Pursuant to the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>Y</em> must capitalize the $90,000 (customer list #2) because it is a category 1 intangible asset. Customer list #2 is an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible, subject to 15-year amortization, because it is a customer list obtained as part of acquiring a business. As for the $60,000 associated with self-created customer list #1, it is not a category 1 or 2 intangible asset. As long as it is not a category 3 intangible asset,<sup><a href=\"#10\">10</a></sup> it would not be capitalized under the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations. Consequently, for year 1, <em>Y</em> could deduct $60,000.</p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Separately Obtained Amortizable Sec. 197 Intangibles</h5>\\r\\n<p>The following intangible assets are amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles, even though they are obtained separately (i.e., not as part of acquiring a business): franchises and rights granted by a government (e.g., trademarks, tradenames, licenses, permits, liquor licenses, taxicab medallions, landing or takeoff rights, regulated airline routes and television and radio licenses). The cost to renew a franchise or a governmental right is treated as the acquisition of a new amortizable Sec. 197 intangible. Under Sec. 197(f)(4)(B), the renewal cost is amortized over a new 15-year period, beginning in the month of renewal. </p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 3—liquor license:</em></strong> For many years, <em>A</em> Co. did not serve alcohol in its restaurant. On May 1 of year 1, <em>A</em> paid $36,000 to local authorities for a five-year liquor license.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Under the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>A</em> must capitalize the $36,000, because the liquor license is a category 2 intangible asset. Even though it is obtained separately, and not as part of acquiring a business, it is an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible, subject to 15-year amortization.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 4—license renewal:</em></strong> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except the date is May 1, year 5, four years after the five-year liquor license was purchased. <em>A</em> pays $27,000 to renew the liquor license for another three years, thereby extending its expiration date from April 30, year 6, to April 30, year 9.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Pursuant to the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>A</em> must capitalize the $27,000, because the renegotiated or upgraded amount is a category 2 intangible asset. The cost to renew the liquor license is treated as a new amortizable Sec. 197 intangible, subject to 15-year amortization, beginning in May, year 5 (month of renewal). In addition, the cost of the original liquor license would continue to be amortized over its remaining 15-year period.</p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Self-Created Amortizable Sec. 197 Intangibles</h5>\\r\\n<p>The following intangible assets are amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles, even though they are self-created and not purchased: covenants not to compete and rights granted by a government (e.g., trademarks, tradenames, licenses, permits, etc.).</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 5—trademark:</em></strong> <em>V</em> Co. pays $45,000 to develop and register a trademark. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Even though the trademark is self-created, it is an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible subject to 15-year amortization.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Sec. 167 Cost Recovery</h3>\\r\\n<p>Sec. 197(b) provides that when Sec. 197 applies, 15-year amortization takes precedence over all other cost recovery rules, including those under Sec. 167. If intangible assets are not amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles (because, for instance, they were not obtained as part of acquiring a business), they would be amortized (if at all) pursuant to other authority, including Sec. 167.</p>\\r\\n<p>Numerous cost recovery rules are contained in Sec. 167. According to Regs. Sec. 1.167(a)-3(a), the cost of an intangible asset “known from experience or other factors to be of use…for only a limited period, the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy,” is amortized over such period. Accordingly, with the exception of the 15-year amortization safe harbor discussed below, the cost of intangible assets is amortized under Sec. 167 only if taxpayers can show that such assets have limited useful lives that are reasonably ascertainable. Cost recovery is denied for intangible assets whose useful lives are not limited or cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy. In such a case, the cost is recovered when the intangible asset is abandoned or otherwise disposed of, or when the enterprise that capitalized the expenditure ceases operation.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 6—covenants not to compete:</em></strong> In year 1, <em>M</em> Co. entered into two covenants not to compete (CNCs). In CNC #1, <em>M</em> purchased a bookkeeping practice from <em>A; M</em> paid $72,000 to <em>A</em> in exchange for <em>A’</em>s promise not to open a bookkeeping practice within a 50-mile radius for three years. In CNC #2, <em>M</em> terminated the employment of executive <em>B,</em> and as part of a severance package, <em>M</em> paid $360,000 in exchange for <em>B’</em>s promise not to work for certain competitors of <em>M</em> for three years.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Under the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>M</em> must capitalize both payments ($72,000 and $360,000), because the CNCs are category 2 intangible assets. CNC #1 is an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible, because it was obtained as part of acquiring a business. Even though CNC #1 has a term of three years, it is amortized over 15 years. CNC #2 was not obtained as part of acquiring a business, so it is not an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible. Because the duration of CNC #2 can be estimated with reasonable accuracy (three years), the $360,000 would be amortized over that period.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 7—signing bonus:</em></strong> In year 1, <em>Z</em> Co. enters into a four-year employment contract with executive C. To induce C to leave his former employer, <em>Z</em> pays him a $240,000 signing bonus.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Under certain circumstances,<sup><a href=\"#11\">11</a></sup> pursuant to the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>Z</em> must capitalize the $240,000 because the contract right is a category 2 intangible asset. Because the duration of the employment contract can be estimated with reasonable accuracy (four years), the signing bonus would be amortized over that period.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 8—prepaid expenses:</em></strong> On Sept. 1, year 1, <em>D</em> Co. paid a $24,000 premium for a two-year insurance policy that will provide coverage from Sept. 1, year 1, to Aug. 31, year 3.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Under the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>D</em> must capitalize the $24,000, because the insurance (prepaid expense) is a category 2 intangible asset. Because the duration of the insurance policy can be estimated with reasonable accuracy (two years), the prepaid insurance would be amortized over that period.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 9—purchase of ownership interest:</em></strong> <em>R,</em> an individual, paid $30,000 for stock in <em>P</em> Co.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Pursuant to the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>R</em> must capitalize the $30,000, because the ownership interest is a category 1 intangible asset. Because the useful life of this intangible asset is not limited, there is no amortization deduction. <em>R</em> recovers the $30,000 when she disposes of the stock. For instance, if <em>R</em> sells the stock for $35,000, she would report a $5,000 gain ($35,000 – $30,000).</p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Contract Termination Payments</h5>\\r\\n<p>Contract termination payment issues arise in a number of situations, including a landlord’s payment to induce a tenant to prematurely terminate a lease and vacate the premises. Under the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, the landlord must capitalize the contract termination payment, because it is a category 2 intangible asset.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 10—lease-cancellation fee:</em></strong> A landlord, <em>L,</em> pays a $48,000 lease-cancellation fee, because it needs the additional space for itself.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Because the payment is made for the property’s use for the remainder of the lease term, <em>L</em> would amortize the $48,000 capitalized cancellation fee over the remaining term (four years) of the cancelled lease.<sup><a href=\"#12\">12</a></sup> This is true even if the property is subsequently leased to another tenant in an independently conceived transaction.<sup><a href=\"#13\">13</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 11—lease-cancellation fee:</em></strong> <em>L,</em> from the previous example, pays the lease-cancellation fee because it wants to construct improvements on the premises.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The capitalized cancellation fee of $48,000 is considered an additional cost of the improvements<sup><a href=\"#14\">14</a></sup> and would be recovered through depreciation of the improvements, even if the premises are being constructed for a new tenant.<sup><a href=\"#15\">15</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 12—lease-cancellation fee:</em></strong> <em>L,</em> from the previous example, pays the lease-cancellation fee because it wants to rent the premises to a new tenant who is willing to pay more rent than the current one. <em>L</em> enters into a six-year lease with the new tenant.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The capitalized cancellation fee of $48,000 would be amortized over the six-year term of the new lease. This result is reasonable, because the cancellation fee resembles a lease acquisition cost that, under Sec. 178, would be amortized over the term of the new lease.<sup><a href=\"#16\">16</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>15-Year Amortization Safe Harbor</h5>\\r\\n<p>When the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations were issued, the Sec. 167 regulations were amended to clarify the amortization rules for self-created intangible assets (category 2 intangible assets) that are not amortizable Sec. 197 intangibles. New Regs. Sec. 1.167(a)-(3)(b) provides for a 15-year amortization safe harbor. In essence, it applies (1) to created intangible assets (category 2 intangible assets), (2) with unascertainable useful lives, (3) for which another amortization period is not prescribed by the Code, regulations or published guidance and (4) for which amortization is not prohibited.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example 13—membership fee:</em></strong> In year 1, <em>F</em> Co. paid an initiation fee (membership fee) of $60,000 to become a member of a trade association.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Pursuant to the <em>INDOPCO</em> regulations, <em>F</em> must capitalize the $60,000, because the membership fee is a category 2 intangible asset. It is not an amortizable Sec. 197 intangible. If <em>F</em> can establish from experience or other factors that the membership has a useful life shorter than 15 years, it could amortize the $60,000 over the shorter period. If the membership is for an indefinite period, so that <em>F</em> cannot establish its useful life, the 15-year amortization safe harbor would apply.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Planning tip:</em></strong> The newly created 15-year amortization safe harbor under Sec. 167 is not mandatory. If taxpayers can support a shorter amortization period, through their experience with similar assets or economic life studies, they can accelerate their amortization deductions.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p>Part II of this article, in the May 2007 issue, will discuss other aspects of capitalizing and amortizing intangible assets, such as the income-forecast method, lease acquisitions, options, computer software, and transaction and business acquisition costs.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>For more information about this article, contact Prof. Witner at <a href=\"mailto:lwitner@cox.net\">lwitner@cox.net</a></em></p>\\r\\n<em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> This article was awarded </em>The Tax Adviser'<em>s Best Article Award for 2007.</em><br>\\r\\n<hr>\\r\\n<h5>Notes</h5>\\r\\n<p><sup><a id=1 name=1>1</a></sup> TD 9107 (1/5/04).</p>\\r\\n<p><sup><a id=2 name=2>2</a></sup> See, e.g., Melone, “Final Intangible Asset Regulations Modify and Clarify, but Conform in Most Respects, to the Proposed Rules,” 31 <em>J Corp.

The shares were deposited in an account maintained by <em>O</em> in <em>P’</em>s name. However, <em>P</em> became the registered owner and acquired the right to vote the shares, receive dividends and pledge the stock as collateral for a loan. <em>O</em> obtained a security interest in the shares; <em>M</em> was completely divested of any interest in the shares, because it had been paid in full with the funds from the margin loan. </p>\\r\\n<p>Per his agreement with <em>O, P</em> was not required to make any periodic principal or interest payments on the margin loan. Rather, he merely was required to maintain a predetermined minimum balance of cash and/or collateral in the account. The loan agreement included deficiency clauses, under which <em>O</em> was authorized to liquidate the stock if the account balance fell below this minimum threshold; <em>P</em> agreed to be liable for any deficiency in his accounts. </p>\\r\\n<p>In March 2001, <em>P</em> paid off the <em>O</em> margin loans. <em>P</em> asserts that the stock transactions were taxable when he paid off the margin loan in 2001, rather than when he obtained ownership of the stock from <em>M</em> in 2000.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Analysis </h3>\\r\\n<p>Under Sec. 83(a), the financial gain realized by an employee on exercising stock options is taxable as gross income in the year the options were exercised if two prerequisites are met. First, under Regs. Sec. 1.83-1(a)(1) and -3(a)(1), the shares must be “transferred” to the employee, which occurs when the employee acquires “a beneficial ownership interest” in the stock. Second, the shares must become “substantially vested” in the employee, which happens when the stock becomes “either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.” If both conditions are satisfied, the employee realizes gross income equal to the difference between the stock’s fair market value at the moment it became substantially vested and the amount paid to exercise the options. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Transfer:</em></strong> Whether a transaction is a stock transfer or the grant of an option to purchase the stock in the future is a question of fact under Regs. Sec. 1.83-3(a)(2). This determination is made by analyzing “the type of property involved, the extent to which the risk that the property will decline in value has been transferred, and the likelihood that the purchase price will, in fact, be paid.”</p>\\r\\n<p>On exercising his stock options, the purchase price of the stock was, in fact, paid to <em>M,</em> and <em>P</em> became the stock’s beneficial (and actual) owner. Any risk of decline in the value of the shares was transferred from <em>M</em> to <em>P.</em> Whether <em>P</em> ultimately transferred that risk to <em>O</em> has no bearing on our analysis; a transfer from <em>M</em> to <em>P</em> indisputably occurred in 2000. </p>\\r\\n<p><em>P</em> incorrectly cites Regs. Sec. 1.83-3(a)(7), <em>Example 2,</em> as support for his position that a transfer did not occur until he repaid the margin loan. However, the corporation in that example was never paid for the stock and, because the employee did not have any personal liability on the note used to pay for the stock, there is a very real possibility that the corporation would never be paid. This case is significantly different, because <em>M</em> was paid in full and transferred all of its rights in its stock to <em>P. </em></p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Substantially vested:</em></strong> Whether the stock was substantially vested is also a question of fact under Regs. Sec. 1.83-3(b) and (c). Stock becomes substantially vested “when it is either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.” “A substantial risk of forfeiture exists” when the transferred property rights are conditioned “upon the future performance (or refraining from performance) of substantial services by any person, or the occurrence of a condition related to a purpose of the transfer [under which] the possibility of forfeiture is substantial if such condition is not satisfied” (Regs.

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClass96C3344AE6C84538A9DF9C76C01FDB35><div class=ExternalClassD379B4AAA8FD4A3195A316BAC15CE851>\\r\\n<div class=SmallText><i>Co-Editors: Michael Metz, CPA; Nick Gruidl, CPA, MBT </i></div>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>T</strong>he founders of a new venture are often entrepreneurs who have the ideas and relationships to start and create a successful venture, but not the capital to sustain and develop it. Venture capitalists, private-equity funds and public markets satisfy the needs of the new venture and its founders. However, whether at inception or at a later date, capital infusions are not without their tax pitfalls. When the founders, in exchange for bringing investors into their venture, receive a large equity interest in exchange for a relatively small capital contribution, Sec. 83 could require them to recognize substantial ordinary income. A common solution is the use of a partnership or limited liability company (LLC) and the issuance of profits<strong> </strong>interests to alleviate Sec. 83’s effect. However, in many cases, the LLC does not enjoy the same access as corporations to the capital markets, so the Sec. 83 risks remain substantial for many start-up ventures. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In general, Sec. 83 applies to a transfer of property in connection with the performance of services. Stock issued in connection with services is compensatory and requires the recipient to recognize ordinary income, to the extent the value of the property received exceeds that of the consideration given; see Sec. 83(a). When stock received in a compensatory transfer is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the receipt is taxable only when that risk lapses. However, the recipient will recognize ordinary income on any appreciation between the date of the initial transfer and the risk’s lapse. The recipient may elect under Sec. 83(b), within 30 days from the date of the transfer, to be taxed in the year of transfer rather than waiting until the property is fully vested and recognizing the appreciation as additional compensation. If the issuance is not made in connection with the performance of services, it is capital in nature. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Performance of Services</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">For Sec. 83 to apply, the property must have been transferred “in connection with the performance of services.” A transfer is subject to Sec. 83 whether in connection with past, present or future services; see Regs. Sec. 1.83-3(f). Neither Sec. 83 nor Congress has specifically addressed what constitutes a transfer in connection with the performance of services. The courts have generally held that Sec. 83 was intended to apply broadly; see <em>Alves, </em>79 TC 894 (1982), aff’d, 734 F2d 478 (9th Cir. 1984). The Ninth Circuit has stated that “Congress made section 83(a) applicable to all restricted ‘property’ not just stock; to property transferred to ‘any person,’ not just to employees; and to property transferred ‘in connection with…services’ not just compensation for employment.” Thus, for Sec. 83 to apply, a relationship must exist between the services performed and the property transferred; see <em>Montelepre Systemed, Inc., </em>TC Memo 1991-46, aff’d,<em> </em>956 F2d 496 (5th Cir. 1992). </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">To determine whether such a relationship exists, the courts look to all facts and circumstances, and generally apply the following four-factor analysis, with no one factor controlling: (1) whether the property right was granted at the time of employment or initial association as an independent contractor, (2) whether property restrictions are linked to employment or tenure as a contractor, (3) whether the property was transferred in consideration for the performance of services and (4) the transferor’s intent. See <em>Montelepre Systemed, Inc.</em>; <em>Centel Communications Co.,</em> 92 TC 612 (1989), aff’d, 920 F2d 1335 (7th Cir. 1990); <em>Bagley,</em> 85 TC 663 (1985), aff’d, 806 F2d 169 (8th Cir. 1986); and <em>Alves</em>.<em></em></p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Example 1: </em></strong><em>A </em>and <em>B</em>, founders, along with <em>P</em>, a private-equity or venture capital group, form <em>X</em> Corp. in a transaction to which Sec. 351 applies. <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> together contribute $20 for a 20% stake (20 common shares). <em>P</em> contributes $800 for an 80% stake (80 common shares). <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are both key employees of <em>X</em> and operate the business on a daily basis. In addition, <em>A’</em>s and <em>B’</em>s shares may or may not be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In all likelihood, under the four-factor analysis, the transfer of shares is in connection with <em>services</em> performed by <em>A </em>and<em> B</em> for <em>X</em>. Under Sec. 83(a), <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> will recognize ordinary income to the extent the fair market value (FMV) of the stock received exceeds the amount paid. <em>A </em>and <em>B</em> received a 20% stake in <em>X </em>for $20. At the time of that transfer, <em>X</em> was worth $820 (or, perhaps, $1,000 ($800/80%)). Thus, <em>A’</em>s and <em>B’</em>s 20% stake is worth $164 (or $200), and they must recognize income of $144 (or $180); see Levin, <em>Structuring Venture Capital, Private Equity and Entrepreneurial Transactions</em> (Aspen, 2006, ¶201.1.1. <em>X</em> will be able to take a $144 compensation deduction. As a start-up venture, <em>X </em>likely has no income to offset losses, which will be deferred until the corporation becomes profitable. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote><blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Example 2:</em> </strong><em>P</em> contributes $800 for 80% of <em>X’</em>s common shares, but does so six months after <em>X’</em>s incorporation. If, at the time of incorporation, there was no binding agreement between either <em>A</em> and <em>B </em>or <em>X</em> and <em>P</em> for <em>P’</em>s subsequent investment, and the step-transaction doctrine does not apply, each investment should be looked at separately.  </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Presumably, during the first six months of operation, A and B began to develop X and laid the groundwork for a successful venture. Assume that A and B formed X to expand their operations through a “roll up” of multiple targets in a growing new industry (e.g., alternative or renewable energy), with the thought of eventually going public. Within the first six months, they may have identified and negotiated with targets and lenders; however, X needs P’s investment to complete the transaction. Thus, when P enters X, the company is worth considerably more than six months earlier. A and B argue that P paid FMV for the X stock (as a result of arm’s-length negotiations), and there was no transfer of value to the founders; see Levin, ¶201.1.2(2).</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">On formation, X was (in theory, at least) worth only the $20 A and B contributed. Thus, assuming the stock is not restricted, regardless of whether the X shares were received in connection with the performance of services, the transfer should be nontaxable; the value of the property received equals the amount paid for it. However, following P’s investment and the roll-up, A and B’s 20% interest is worth substantially more than the $20 they invested.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Taxpayers and tax advisers should be wary; any determination like this is strictly on a facts-and-circumstances and valuation basis, which carries with it the risk of audit and hazards of litigation. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Subsequent Restrictions</strong></p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Example 3</strong>: </em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that when <em>P</em> invests, restrictions are placed on <em>A’</em>s and <em>B’</em>s shares. (This is not an uncommon practice, because <em>X’</em>s value depends in large part on <em>A</em> and <em>B.</em>) The restrictions protect <em>P’</em>s investment until certain performance measures are met or <em>X</em> goes public. The restriction may be tied to <em>A’</em>s and <em>B’</em>s employment and, thus, appears to be in connection with the performance of services. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">However, the IRS has ruled in similar situations that subsequent restrictions on already fully vested shares cannot cause Sec. 83 to apply to the transaction. In IRS Letter Ruling 200212005, the Service ruled that subsequent restrictions placed on fully vested shares did not cause Sec. 83 to apply, as there was no property transfer; thus, a vesting restriction subsequently placed on fully vested shares should not cause a Sec. 83 event; see Rizzi, “Equity and Quasi-Equity: The Impact of Section 83 on Reorganization in the Technology Section,” 29 <em>Corp. Tax’n</em> 5 (September/October 2002).<strong><em> </em></strong></p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Example 4:</em> </strong>The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that <em>P</em> receives preferred (rather than common) stock in the transaction (as is normal with private-equity-fund investments). <em>P</em> invests $800; <em>A</em> and <em>B </em>invest $20. However, <em>P</em> receives 80 shares of preferred stock that carry a liquidation preference, cumulative dividend and an “as if common” feature after payment of the cumulative return, while <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> receive 20 shares of common stock. In the event of an initial public offering, the preferred stock converts to common and any cumulative accrued dividends are lost. The contention would be that <em>P’</em>s preferred stock is worth far more than <em>A’</em>s and <em>B’</em>s common stock, and <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>received property with a value equal to the consideration paid for it.<em></em></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Just as in Example 2, this position is a facts-and-circumstances analysis and a valuation issue. The concern is that the common shares receive a substantially disproportionate share of future appreciation, similar to the value of an option privilege. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">While there are Sec. 83 risks associated with equity issuances to founders in a start-up venture, proper planning should allow founders to realize the benefit of their “sweat equity” in capital, rather than compensation.</p>\\r\\n<p> </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

If this interpretation remains, it virtually eliminates the Sec. 67(e) exception to the 2% rule for estates and trusts and puts the Second Circuit in conflict with every other circuit that has interpreted this statute.<sup><a href=\"#2\">2</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<p>The Second Circuit held that Sec. 67(e) grants an estate or trust an exception from the 2% reduction in itemized deductions only for “costs of a type” that “individuals are incapable of incurring.” On the surface, the court appeared to create a narrow window for an estate or trust to claim a full deduction for its administrative costs. In reality, however, it potentially eliminates a full deduction for <em>any </em>administrative cost of an estate or trust. </p>\\r\\n<p>The court endorsed only three costs as fully deductible, because “individuals are incapable of incurring” them—“fees paid to trustees, expenses associated with judicial accountings, and the costs of preparing and filing fiduciary income tax returns.” However, one could argue that even these do not pass muster under the Second Circuit’s strict interpretation, because individuals are fully capable of incurring these costs. It makes sense that they would, because trustees are nothing more than titleholders for property beneficially owned by an individual. Thus, it is nearly impossible to conceive of a cost that trustees can incur with respect to property that an individual cannot.</p>\\r\\n<p>This article examines how the Second Circuit reached its decision and how trustees and practitioners should respond to this questionable ruling.</p>\\r\\n<h3>The Controversy</h3>\\r\\n<p>Dozens of law reviews and journals have discussed the interpretation of Sec. 67(e) since the controversy first arose in <em>O’Neill.</em><sup><a href=\"#3\">3</a></sup> So far, none has urged the interpretation adopted by the Second Circuit. Indeed, the panel’s interpretation even conflicts with IRS Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, and most state fiduciary income tax forms, which allow a full deduction for legal and accounting fees. Under the court’s definition, legal and accounting fees should not be fully deductible (at least in the Second Circuit), because individuals are capable of incurring them. Thus, the court’s interpretation is bound to foster confusion and noncompliance.</p>\\r\\n<p>While the $4,448 deficiency in <em>Rudkin</em> is undoubtedly small, the Second Circuit’s position has serious implications. Its endorsement and application will create a substantial tax debt for trustees who must incur costs to comply with their legally mandated duties, such as those imposed under the Uniform Prudent Investor Act. It will also generate substantial litigation over a basic deduction that Congress intended for trustees carrying out such duties, all based on a questionable interpretation.</p>\\r\\n<h3>The Case </h3>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Two-Prong Test</h5>\\r\\n<p>The question before the Second Circuit was whether Sec. 67(e) exempted $22,241 of investment advisory fees paid by the Rudkin Trust from the “2% rule” in Sec. 67(a), or required the fees to be reduced by 2% of the trust’s adjusted gross income (AGI). Sec. 67(a) allows individuals to deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent that they exceed 2% of AGI. Estates and trusts are generally subject to the same rules for determining income and deductions as individuals, except when specifically provided otherwise in numerous other Code sections.<sup><a href=\"#4\">4</a></sup> Sec. 67(e) is one of these many exceptions. It allows estates and trusts a full deduction for miscellaneous itemized deductions “paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust ...which would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate.” </p>\\r\\n<p>The exception is structured as a two-prong test. First, costs must be “paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust.” Second, those costs “would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such trust or estate.” While the first prong is not in contention, no one can agree on what the second prong means. </p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Other Circuit Decisions</h5>\\r\\n<p>Four circuits have now weighed in on the meaning of the disputed phrase. In 1993, the Sixth Circuit interpreted Sec. 67(e) to allow estates and trusts a full deduction for costs “incurred because of fiduciary duties.”<sup><a href=\"#5\">5</a></sup> But, in 2001, the Federal Circuit disagreed and construed Sec. 67(e) as allowing a full deduction only for costs “not commonly incurred by individuals.”<sup><a href=\"#6\">6</a></sup> Two years later, the Fourth Circuit<sup><a href=\"#7\">7</a></sup> echoed the Federal Circuit’s opinion. Most recently, the Second Circuit resoundingly rejected them all, declaring that Sec. 67(e) allows a full deduction only for costs that “individuals are incapable of incurring.” Ironically, the only controversy the four circuits resolved is that the statute is “plain and unambiguous.” Accordingly, none of them considered it necessary to consult the statute’s legislative history. </p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Court’s Rationale</h5>\\r\\n<p>In holding that the second clause of Sec. 67(e) allows a full deduction only for costs that “individuals are incapable of incurring,” the court explained that this comports with the “plain meaning” of the statute. Yet, it is hard to reconcile the Second Circuit’s assertion that the statute is “plain,” when reaching its conclusion required significant alteration of the statutory text and no other court agrees with its interpretation. </p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>“Would” Means “Could”</h5>\\r\\n<p>Despite Congress’s deliberate choice of “would” in the second clause of Sec. 67(e), the Second Circuit’s analysis interpreted “would” as “could.” In doing so, it changed the statute from one that allows a full deduction for costs that <em>would</em> <em>not</em> have been incurred without <em>the</em> trust, to one that only allows costs that <em>could</em> not be incurred without <em>a</em> trust. One cannot help but question the court’s justification for this change, because “would” does not mean the same as “could.” “Would” expresses probability or presumption, whereas “could” denotes capability.<sup><a href=\"#8\">8</a></sup> These words are not ordinarily interchangeable. </p>\\r\\n<p>Further, the court held that “such trust” means “a generic trust.” This is also questionable, because “such” is a pointing word with a clear antecedent—the trust that paid or incurred the cost. Changing “such trust” to “a generic trust” changes the statute from a particularized inquiry about whether the costs were incurred because of <em>such</em> trust, to a general inquiry about whether the costs can be incurred outside of a trust <em>at all</em>. Indeed, it guts the very exception that Congress intended for administrative costs of estates and trusts, because there is arguably no cost that trustees can incur that “individuals are incapable of incurring.” </p>\\r\\n<p>Finally, and without explanation, the <em>Rudkin</em> court concluded that the statute “logically directs the inquiry away from the trust and back toward the hypothetical ownership of the property by an individual.” Yet the statute says nothing about an individual property owner; rather, Sec. 67(e) specifically focuses on “costs which are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust”—<em>not</em> those that might be incurred by an individual.  </p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Sec. 67(e)</h5>\\r\\n<p>The court appeared to ignore the context in which Sec. 67(e) appears—i.e., as one of many exceptions to the 2% rule. Reading Sec. 67 in its entirety reveals a nearly identical exception contained in Sec. 67(d) for handicapped individuals. Sec. 67(d) allows a full deduction for “expenses in connection with <em>such</em> place of employment which are necessary for <em>such</em> individual to be able to work…” (emphasis added). It is almost a carbon copy of Sec. 67(e). Like Sec. 67(e), it provides an exemption to the 2% rule for a special class of taxpayer not likely to abuse miscellaneous itemized deductions—handicapped individuals. Also like Sec. 67(e), it imposes two requirements to meet the exception. First, expenses must be incurred “in connection with <em>such</em> place of employment.” Second, they must be “necessary for <em>such</em> individual to be able to work.” “Such” clearly refers to the particular handicapped person and his or her place of employment—<em>not</em> a generic handicapped person or place of work. </p>\\r\\n<p>If one were to interpret Sec. 67(d) in the same manner as the Second Circuit interpreted Sec. 67(e), handicapped individuals could deduct only the types of expenses that nonhandicapped persons are incapable of incurring in a generic place of employment. This would nearly eliminate almost every type of job-related deduction for handicapped people. For example, they could not fully deduct the cost of telephone headsets, speaker phones, voice-activated computers, automatic door openers, elevator service or any other expenses that nonhandicapped individuals are capable of incurring. </p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Superfluous Clause </h5>\\r\\n<p>The Second Circuit’s holding that the second prong means costs that “individuals are incapable of incurring,” renders the first prong useless, because all costs described in the second prong are covered under the first. That is, all costs that “individuals are incapable of incurring” are necessarily those incurred “in connection with the administration of the estate or trust.” Thus, the statute could just as easily have been written without the first clause and simply allowed estates and trusts a full deduction only for “costs that individuals are incapable of incurring.” Canons of statutory interpretation do not ordinarily permit interpreting a statute in a manner that renders a portion of it superfluous.<sup><a href=\"#9\">9</a></sup> </p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Legislative History</h5>\\r\\n<p>If the statute was ambiguous, the court should have embraced the legislative history for clarification. Had it done so, it would have found evidence that Congress intended to broadly exempt <em>all</em> administrative costs of estates and trusts from the 2% floor, except those that are not directly related to the fiduciary’s administrative duties.<sup><a href=\"#10\">10</a></sup> The <em>Rudkin</em> briefs laid the entire legislative history before the court in a detailed narrative. </p>\\r\\n<p>The 2% floor was enacted to eliminate extensive recordkeeping for small and essentially personal items that individuals often claimed as miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as “safe deposit expenses…and…subscriptions to widely read publications.”<sup><a href=\"#11\">11</a></sup> However, Congress recognized that not all taxpayers abused miscellaneous itemized deductions. Among those who did not were trustees and executors of nongrantor trusts and estates. Thus, both houses of Congress agreed to grant an exception to the 2%-of-AGI floor for estates and nongrantor trusts. This exception, contained in Sec. 67(e), allowed a full deduction for all administrative costs of estates and trusts.<sup><a href=\"#12\">12</a></sup> There was no second prong.  </p>\\r\\n<p>This original version of Sec. 67(e), granting a full deduction for all administrative costs of estates and trusts, remained intact for nearly a year as the House and Senate bills wound their way through Congress and into the Joint Conference Committee. There, the conferees questioned whether the exception for administrative costs of estates and trusts should also cover administrative costs from flowthrough entities in which the trust invested.<sup><a href=\"#13\">13</a></sup> Such administrative costs were generally unrelated to the trustee’s administrative duties; rather, they related to the administration of the passthrough entity. Should they also be fully deductible as administrative costs of the estate or trust? To resolve the issue, the conferees added the second prong, which clarified that only administrative costs directly attributable to the trustee’s administrative duties are fully deductible<sup><a href=\"#14\">14</a></sup> (i.e., those costs that would not have been incurred had it not been for such trust). Congress never intended this phrase to eliminate wholly the exception for administrative costs that it carefully granted in the first prong. </p>\\r\\n<p>Although the court noted that the legislative history “provides some indication that the second clause of section 67(e) was drafted to address indirect deductions through pass-through entities,” it dismissed this by explaining: </p>\\r\\n<p>If Congress’s only purpose had been to restrict the ability of trusts as ultimate taxpayers to deduct fully their share of the administrative costs of pass-through entities in which they had invested, however, it could have drafted the second clause of section 67(e)(1) more narrowly. It could have, for example, permitted full deductibility for those administrative costs which are not pass-through costs restricted under section 67(c).<sup><a href=\"#15\">15</a></sup> </p>\\r\\n<p>However, the court apparently overlooked the fact that Sec. 67(c) is expressly inapplicable to estates and trusts. Thus, the court suggests that the statute should have permitted estates and trusts a full deduction for costs that are not restricted by a statute that does not apply to them. It is doubtful that Congress would have entertained such a meaningless provision.   </p>\\r\\n<p>The court’s failure to address the legislative history blinded it to Congress’s purpose in drafting the second clause of Sec. 67(e). The language Congress chose, while not perfect, allows a full deduction for costs, including those from pass-through entities that were incurred <em>because of the trustee’s fiduciary duties</em>. Trusts frequently form passthrough entities to carry out some or all of their fiduciary duties. To the extent the trust can show that the administrative costs of the passthrough entity were incurred because of the trustee, they should be fully deductible under the statute. But costs from passthrough entities in which the trust is merely a passive investor and that would have been incurred regardless of the trust are not fully deductible.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Ruling’s Effect</h3>\\r\\n<p>The <em>Rudkin</em> ruling potentially affects the four million estates and trusts that file tax returns with the IRS each year.<sup><a href=\"#16\">16</a></sup> Moreover, because estates and trusts report over $85 billion of AGI, there is an enormous amount at stake.<sup><a href=\"#17\">17</a></sup> Estates and trusts pay $9.8 billion a year for legal, accounting, tax reporting, asset management and other costs that are now subject to partial disallowance under the court’s ruling.<sup><a href=\"#18\">18</a></sup> They also pay trustees $3.9 billion a year to perform these services.<sup><a href=\"#19\">19</a></sup> This decision is especially hard on fiduciaries and beneficiaries in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, because the Tax Court is bound to follow the Second Circuit’s ruling in cases involving those residents. Approximately 10% of all estates and trusts reside in the Second Circuit.<sup><a href=\"#20\">20</a></sup> </p>\\r\\n<p>How will executors and trustees react to the court’s interpretation? Some will undoubtedly ignore it as an aberration. Others may simply avoid seeking any form of professional advice because it is not tax deductible, and, thus, not cost-effective to do so. To the extreme, some trusts may relocate outside the Second Circuit to a more favorable jurisdiction. Regardless, none of these reactions squares with sound tax policy or Congress’s original intent to allow estates and trusts a full deduction for administrative costs incurred because of their legally mandated duties.</p>\\r\\n<p>Millions of beneficiaries will also be affected by the court’s decision. On audit, the Service will treat beneficiaries in the Second Circuit differently from all others, even in the same trust. They will owe a tax on “phantom income,” to the extent they receive distributions from a trust that have been reduced by any costs that individuals “are capable of incurring” and for which the trust has been denied a deduction.<sup><a href=\"#21\">21</a></sup> This deviation from the standard employed elsewhere will have broad economic and policy implications for all trustees and beneficiaries. </p>\\r\\n<p>The Second Circuit’s interpretation also conflicts with the IRS’s interpretation of Sec. 67(e).In briefs before the Second Circuit and at oral argument, the government supported the position maintained by the Fourth and Federal Circuits (i.e., the second prong allows a full deduction only for costs that individuals do not “commonly incur”). But, more recently, the government took a different position. In CCA 200630016, <sup><a href=\"#22\">22</a></sup> the Service held that a bankruptcy estate is a “trust or estate” within the meaning of Sec. 67(e): </p>\\r\\n<p>Therefore, applying § 67(e) to a debtor’s estate in bankruptcy, the deduction for expenses paid or incurred in connection with administration of an estate in bankruptcy that would not have been incurred had the property not been held in such estate is treated as allowable in arriving at adjusted gross income. </p>\\r\\n<p>The CCA expressly follows <em>In re:</em> <em>Miller</em>,<sup><a href=\"#23\">23</a></sup> which allowed a debtor’s estate in bankruptcy a full deduction for telephone, postage, mileage, copies, legal and accounting fees and other expenses “paid or incurred in connection with administration of an estate in bankruptcy that would not have been incurred had the property not been held in such estate.” Such costs are frequently incurred outside of bankruptcy. The government’s position in the CCA is certainly not the position it maintained before the Second Circuit in <em>Rudkin</em>.  </p>\\r\\n<p>Hence, the Second Circuit’s opinion conflicts with the Service’s own interpretation of Sec. 67(e), with the decisions of all the other circuit courts, with every legal scholar who has written on this topic, and with all state and Federal fiduciary income tax forms. Thus, it has grave financial implications for estates and trusts and their beneficiaries, especially in the Second Circuit, and will affect all fiduciaries and beneficiaries if the IRS chooses to adopt the court’s holding. Hopefully, this unusual decision will not be the final word on the issue.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Treasury’s Business Plan</h3>\\r\\n<p>Sec. 67 recently appeared for the first time on Treasury’s “Priority Guidance Plan” for estates and trusts for 2006–2007.<sup><a href=\"#24\">24</a></sup> The IRS’s timing is curious, because it now has three different interpretations from which to choose. Alternatively, it could craft an altogether different interpretation of the statute. Once regulations are promulgated, the courts generally give deference to the agency’s interpretation as the body most knowledgeable and charged with administration.<sup><a href=\"#25\">25</a></sup> However, the Service could also decide to wait until the Supreme Court resolves the issue before finalizing any guidance.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Interim Return Positions</h3>\\r\\n<p>In the meantime, trustees and practitioners wishing to avoid penalties for understatement of taxes have several choices. They can label every administrative cost a “fiduciary fee” based on the circuits’ unanimous agreement that trustee fees are fully deductible in all circumstances. There is some basis for this, at least as to investment adviser fees; the Uniform Prudent Investor Act confers fiduciary status on an agent to whom the trustee has delegated all or a portion of the trust’s investment management duties.<sup><a href=\"#26\">26</a></sup> Thus, investment agents’ fees are fiduciary fees. However, trustees run the risk that the IRS may assert the right to unbundle such fees.<sup><a href=\"#27\">27</a></sup> Alternatively, trustees can avoid professional advice and invest solely in mutual funds and other assets that do not necessarily require an investment adviser, assuming such action is prudent. </p>\\r\\n<p>Regardless, trustees and their return preparers should pick an interpretation they are comfortable with and support it with a “well-reasoned construction of the statute.”<sup><a href=\"#28\">28</a></sup> This holds true even for trustees in the Fourth and Second Circuits, who are not bound to follow <em>Scott</em><sup><a href=\"#29\">29</a></sup> and <em>Rudkin</em>. The regulations merely preclude reliance on a case that has been overruled. However, those who take a position contrary to the holding of a circuit court to which their case may be appealed have a guaranteed invitation to file <em>certiorari</em> in the Supreme Court.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Heading for the Supreme Court</h3>\\r\\n<p>Michael J. Knight, trustee of the Rudkin Testamentary Trust, petitioned the Second Circuit to rehear the case <em>en banc.</em><sup><a href=\"#30\">30</a></sup> However, consistent with its policy against rehearings, the Second Circuit denied the petition. It considers the <em>en banc</em> procedure “an often unwieldy and cumbersome device generating little more than delay, costs and continued uncertainty that can ill be afforded at a time of burgeoning calendars. Further, a rehearing will only delay resolution of a case that is of such extraordinary importance that we are confident the Supreme Court will accept these matters under its certiorari jurisdiction. Accordingly, we speed these cases on their way to the Supreme Court as an exercise of sound, prudent and resourceful judicial administration.”<sup><a href=\"#31\">31</a></sup> The <em>Rudkin</em> trustee will test the court’s theory by petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for <em>certiorari</em> in spring 2007.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p>This issue has traveled a long and bumpy road since it was first litigated in 1992 in <em>O’Neill.</em> Four circuits have sifted out three different meanings for this “plain and unambiguous” statute, the IRS has maintained inconsistent positions and trustees and tax preparers beg for guidance. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will deem the case worthy of review this fall.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>Editor’s note:</em> Ms. Cantrell is a member of the AICPA Tax Division’s Trust, Estate &amp; Gift Tax Technical Resource Panel’s Trust Accounting Income Task Force.</p>\\r\\n<p>For more information about this article, contact Ms. Cantrell at <a href=\"mailto:cantrell@bvccpa.com\">cantrell@bvccpa.com</a>.</p>\\r\\n<hr>\\r\\n<h5>Notes</h5>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<p><sup><a id=1 name=1>1</a></sup> <em>William L.

At that time, little guidance was available on how to take the deduction under new Sec. 179D. Since then, the IRS issued Notice 2006-52, providing interim guidance, pending the release of regulations.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The deduction is available for taxpayers that own or lease commercial buildings. To qualify, the energy-efficient property must meet the following requirements:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">It is installed on or in any building located in the U.S. and is within the scope of American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 90.1-2001 (see Notice 2006-52, Sections 5.02 and 5.06, for a complete description); </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">It is installed as part of (1) the interior-lighting systems, (2) the heating, cooling, ventilation and hot-water systems or (3) the building envelope; and </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">The taxpayer has certification that installation of such property will reduce total annual energy and power costs by 50% or more, compared to a “reference building” that meets the minimum requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2001. (The required 50% reduction must be accomplished solely through energy and power cost reductions for the heating, cooling, ventilation, hot-water and interior-lighting systems. Reductions in any other energy uses, such as receptacles, process loads, refrigeration, cooking and elevators, are not taken into account.) </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The maximum deduction allowed cannot exceed $1.80 times the building’s square footage, less the aggregate of any prior-year’s deductions taken for the building under Sec. 179D. If multiple taxpayers install energy-efficient commercial building property on or in the same building, the maximum deduction that may be taken by all such taxpayers cannot exceed such amount.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Square footage:</em></strong> In determining a building’s square footage, all conditioned areas with headroom height of 7.5 feet or greater are included, such as basements, mezzanines, intermediate-floored tiers and penthouses. Items not included are covered walkways, open roofed-over areas, porches or similar spaces, exterior terraces or steps, chimneys, roof overhangs and similar features. Any enclosed space in the building that qualifies as cooled or heated space (i.e., output capacity of the cooling or heating system exceeds 5 British thermal units (BTU) per hour per square foot of floor area) is included, as is indirectly conditioned space (defined as an enclosed space heated or cooled indirectly by being connected to adjacent spaces).</p>\\r\\n<h3>PRM</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Taxpayers must use the performance rating method (PRM) to compute the percentage reduction in total annual energy and power costs. Under the PRM, a reference building is used as a standard to compare to the taxpayer’s building (proposed building). The reference building must be located in the same climate zone and be otherwise comparable to the taxpayer’s building, except that the interior-lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation and hot-water systems, and the building envelope, must meet the minimum requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2001. The first step is to subtract the proposed building’s annual costs from those of the reference building. This difference is then divided by the reference building’s annual energy and power costs to determine the percentage reduction:</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Percentage reduction = <br>\\r\\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Reference building annual costs – Proposed building annual costs</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Reference building annual costs</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> The annual costs of a reference building are $700; the annual costs of a proposed building are $300. Thus, there is a 57% (($700 – $300)/ $700) reduction in energy costs.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<h3>Certification</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Sec. 179D(d)(6) requires a taxpayer to receive certification to ensure that the building complies with energy savings plans and targets. Sec. 179D(d)(6)(C) required certification from a “qualified individual,” but did not define the term. Section 5.05 of Notice 2006-52 defines a qualified individual as one who:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Is not related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 45(e)(4)); </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Is an engineer or contractor properly licensed as a professional engineer or contractor in the jurisdiction in which the building is located;</p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<div></div>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p style=\"text-align:left\">Represents in writing to the taxpayer that he or she has the requisite qualifications to provide the certification required under Section 4 of the notice or to perform the inspection and testing described in Section 4.05. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Notice 2006-52, Section 4, details the items that must be included in the certification to satisfy Sec. 179D(c)(1). Taxpayers need not attach the certification to the return on which the deduction is taken; however, they must maintain sufficient books and records to establish the qualification and amount of the claimed deduction. Information required includes the name, address and telephone number of the qualified individual providing the certification; the address of the building to which the certification applies; a statement that the installed components meet the required percentage reduction of energy costs; a statement that qualified computer software was used to make the calculation; and identification of the software used. The Department of Energy is responsible for creating and maintaining a list of software that may be used to calculate energy and power consumption and costs for purposes of providing the required certification. Currently, there are four approved software programs; see <a href=\"http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=9624\">www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/info/tax_credit_2006.html.</a> </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Subject to certification, a taxpayer may take a partial deduction if one of the systems allowed under Sec. 179D(c)(1)(C) (i.e., interior-lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation and hot-water systems, or the building envelope) reduces the total annual energy and power costs by 16⅔% or more when compared to ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2001. The maximum partial deduction available is up to 60¢ per square foot.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Effective Date</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">As originally written, Sec. 179D applied to property placed in service after 2005 and before 2008. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the placed-in-service date to before 2009. There are also several bills now before Congress to extend this date even further and to increase the deduction allowed.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClass893D0433DF2F4B859EF6348286C930A2><p><strong>B</strong>eginning in 2006, there is a new deduction available for updating or constructing commercial building property to be more energy efficient. The Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2005 (ETIA), which took four years to pass, added new Sec. 179D. With so many commercial buildings exceeding 15 years in age, many business owners and landlords may be considering significant updates to enable more economical operation. Sec. 179D provides an immediate deduction for the cost of energy-efficient improvements to commercial property.</p>\\r\\n<p>The maximum deduction allowed cannot exceed $1.80 per square foot of the building, less the aggregate of all prior-year deductions taken for the building under this provision. The property basis is then reduced by the deduction taken. Although this new deduction will primarily benefit real estate businesses, it will have some benefit to owners of commercial lease property.</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>Corporation, <em>B, </em>operates a 10,000 square-foot manufacturing facility located in the U.S. In 2006, as part of a certified overall plan to reduce the total annual energy and power costs, it spends $50,000. Under new Sec. 179D, <em>B </em>can deduct $18,000 ($10,000 $1.80) immediately on its 2006 return. It will then capitalize the $32,000 remainder and depreciate this over the asset’s useful life. In 2007, <em>B</em> spent an additional $50,000 (which is also eligible for the Sec. 179D deduction). Because it already took the total deduction allowed under Sec. 179D in a prior tax year, <em>B </em>has to capitalize the entire amount spent in 20</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\\r\\n<p>As with all new laws, there are specific requirements that must be satisfied to enable taxpayers to claim the new deduction. First, the building must be located in the U.S. and be within the scope of Standard 90.1-2001 as in effect on April 2, 2003. Standard 90.1-2001 is a publication of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (<a href=\"http://www.ashrae.com\">www.ashrae.com</a>) and the Illuminating Society of North America. It provides minimum requirements for the design of energy-efficient buildings. Further, it has general industry acceptance and its language is often used in new building codes.</p>\\r\\n<p>Second, the property must be installed as part of (1) the interior lighting systems, (2) the heating, cooling, ventilation and hot water systems or (3) the building envelope. The term “building envelope” is not defined in Sec. 179D; however, under Sec. 25C(c)(2), the term is defined as including the wall and roof assemblies, insulation, air/vapor retarders, windows and weather-stripping and caulking. While Sec. 25C applies to residential property, it may be reasonable to assume that a similar definition would apply for Sec. 179D purposes. </p>\\r\\n<p>Third, the property must be certified as being installed as part of a plan designed to reduce the total annual energy and power costs with respect to the building’s interior lighting systems and heating, cooling, ventilation and hot water systems by 50% or more in comparison to a reference building that meets the minimum requirements of Standard 90.1-2001. <em>Note:</em> to qualify for the full deduction, the cost reduction plan must target all the systems specifically identified in Sec. 179D(c) (1)(D). The reduction applies to overall energy savings and not the savings of any particular system.</p>\\r\\n<p>The IRS is required to issue regulations that establish a specific, energy-saving target for each system (i.e., interior lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation and hot water) and de-scribe in detail the methods for calculating and verifying energy and power consumption and cost. The regulations will be based on the provisions of the 2005 California Nonresidential Alternative Calculation Method Ap-proval Manual.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sec. 179D(d)(6) outlines the certification process. As part of the regulations, the IRS is expected to provide guidance on how to define qualified plan certifiers, to ensure compliance of buildings with energy savings plans and targets. Such procedures will probably be comparable to the requirements in the Mortgage Industry National Ac-creditation Procedures for Home Energy Rating Systems.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Other Circumstances</h3>\\r\\n<p>Sec. 179D(d)(4) provides a special allocation for improvements to public property. Because the governmental owner is likely not a taxpayer, this section requires the IRS to issue a regulation to allow an allocation of the deduction to the person primarily responsible for designing the property in lieu of the property owner. It is hoped that this tax incentive will further encourage the development and innovation of energy-efficient designs for use in municipal buildings.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although a cost reduction plan should target a building’s overall systems, Sec. 179D(d)(1) provides a partial allowance if a taxpayer replaces one of the systems allowed under Sec. 179D(c) (1)(C), and the replacement meets the target for that system. The partial deduction available for the cost of the systems installed is up to $0.60 per square foot of the building. These system-specific improvements are also subjected to certification as designed by the IRS. This may be an incentive to owners of commercial lease properties, who pass on their utility costs to their tenants, to consider installing energy-efficient systems.</p>\\r\\n<p>In addition to the above, Sec. 179D also directs the IRS to issue regulations as necessary to take into account new technologies and to provide for the recapture of the deduction if a plan is not fully implemented.</p>\\r\\n<p>No final regulations have yet to be issued on these or any of the issues discussed herein.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Effective Date</h3>\\r\\n<p>If taxpayers believe that a major energy savings improvement to a commercial building will be necessary, new Sec. 179D may prove to be economical and thus worth considering. Further, taxpayers in the business of designing energy-efficient government property should be aware of allocated deductions that may be available to them.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Sec. 179D provisions, as currently written, only apply to property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2005 and before 2008.</p>\\r\\n</div>

The directive, along with an associated document entitled “Minimum Checks for Section 199; Law and Explanation,” details the minimum audit checks IRS examiners are expected to complete when scrutinizing a corporation’s Sec. 199 DPAD. The directive is not an official legal pronouncement and cannot be used, cited or relied on as such; however, it provides corporations and their tax advisers with valuable insights on the aspects of Sec. 199 likeliest to be probed on audit. </p>\\r\\n<p class=ExternalClass5509CD4AD5BE4D2C82BD01BE09D720B4><span><i><b>Minimum checks:</b></i> Under the directive, there are five minimum audit checks examiners should undertake to achieve a “comfort level with the taxpayer’s compliance level,” and give “the subsequent year examination teams a base for further review of the deduction.” </span></p>\\r\\n<div class=ExternalClass5509CD4AD5BE4D2C82BD01BE09D720B4>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Does the taxpayer’s business make sense with the DPAD’s activity requirements? Examples: Most resellers (e.g., clothing stores and wholesalers) should not be claiming the deduction, nor should most professional service companies, as they are selling their services, even if in the process they provide a tangible item (such as a legal document). Auditors are instructed to review the corporation’s website and annual report, among other sources, to answer this question. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><span>Compare the domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) reported on Form 8903, Domestic Production Activities Deduction, to the gross receipts or sales less returns and allowances on Form 1120, line 1(c). Gross receipts reported on line 1(c) should be greater than the DPGR reported on line 1 of Form 8903. If the gross receipts on Form 8903 match the gross receipts on line 1(c), the taxpayer may have not allocated to non-DPGR nonqualified income amounts such as gross receipts for services or for resale items, if applicable (this assumes the Regs. Sec. 1.199-1(d)(3)(i) <i>de minimis</i> rule does not apply). However, there may be situations in which DPGR is greater than total gross receipts, such as when partnership or S corporation flowthrough income is not reflected on Form 1120. </span></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Is the taxpayer required to allocate gross receipts to remove nonqualified embedded service income, or determine the qualified income portion of a component of an item? If so, how did the taxpayer determine an allocation method? In some cases, the taxpayer must allocate gross receipts between qualifying and nonqualifying items. For example, if it produces/sells widgets and also buys/sells widgets, only the gross receipts from producing/selling widgets will qualify. In other cases, the taxpayer must allocate the gross receipts of an individual item between qualifying and nonqualifying portions. For example, if it produces/sells an item that includes nonqualifying services, it must make an allocation to determine the qualifying portion. However, no allocation is required when the service portion is one of the items specified in Regs. Sec. 1.199-3(i)(4), such as a qualified warranty, delivery, operating manual or installation not separately stated or separately offered by the taxpayer. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>If the taxpayer is required to use the Sec. 861 method to allocate and apportion deductions, has it used it, and is it consistent with the application of Sec. 861 for foreign tax credit purposes, if applicable? The Sec. 861 method must be used to allocate and apportion deductions if the taxpayer’s average annual gross receipts exceed $100 million or total assets at the end of the tax year exceed $10 million. Within Sec. 861, there are various methods taxpayers can use to make allocations (e.g., gross receipts and asset methods), but they must be consistent with the chosen methods. (For a discussion of the methods, see Rollinson, et al., “Allocation and Apportionment of Expenses for Sec. 199 Purposes,” TTA, June 2006, p. 336.)\\r\\n     </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

Olson said in her annual report to Congress at the end of 2006. The AICPA has also endorsed outright repeal of the individual AMT (similar to S 55, introduced by Sens. Max Baucus (D-MT) and Charles Grassley (R-IA)). Far from its original purpose of thwarting tax-avoidance schemes by the wealthy, the AMT now “is left to punish taxpayers for engaging in such ‘classic tax-avoidance behavior’ as having children or living in a high-tax state,” Olson said, noting that the AMT obviates personal exemptions and deductibility of state and local taxes. The AMT headed Olson’s list of the 21 most serious tax issues, as it has repeatedly since 2001. The next five priorities were, in order: </p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Underpayment of tax (the “tax gap”); </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Lack of transparency in IRS procedures and guidance; </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>The Private Debt Collection program, which Olson said should be scrapped; </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>A need for earlier IRS intervention in collection cases; and </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>Greater use of installment agreements, offers-in-compromise and other alternative collection methods. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p><span>The report is available at <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/advocate/article/0,,id=165806,00.html\">www.irs.gov/advocate/article/0,,id=165806,00.html</a>.</span></p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

The online AMT Assistant is an automated version of <i>Worksheet to see if you should fill in Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax.</i> The worksheet, contained in the Form 1040 instructions, is used to determine how much AMT (if any) a taxpayer owes. The Service projects that most taxpayers using the online AMT Assistant will find that the AMT does not apply to them, and that after they enter their data, they can get an answer in five to 10 minutes.</span></p>\\r\\n<p><span>The AMT Assistant is aimed at individuals and can be used by them, tax practitioners and community or public service organizations. All entries are anonymous. Taxpayers filing paper returns benefit the most from the AMT Assistant, because electronic filing software generally computes AMT liability automatically. Taxpayers can find the tool by entering “AMT Assistant” in the <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/\">www.irs.gov</a> search box. To use the AMT Assistant, taxpayers must complete a draft Form 1040 through line 44 and have that information at hand.</span></p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClass0F78D7F790BD4D74B901E992D3953C5B><p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>A</strong> closely held C corporation that is growing rapidly or plans to enter into a new line of business may consider the creation of a “frozen” limited liability company (LLC)/partnership (frozen partnership) to reduce its income tax liability and shift future appreciation out of the corporation. However, if the frozen partnership’s existence is invalidated, there could be unintended income and/or gift tax consequences to the partners of the putative partnership. In light of recent IRS victories, these risks should be taken seriously. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Service Victories</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Recently, the IRS was successful in invalidating the partnership form as a sham transaction; see <em>Boca Investerings Partnership, </em>314 F3d 625 (DC Cir. 2003) (partnership form must be needed to accomplish a nontax business purpose, otherwise the partnership is a sham), and <em>Asa Investerings Partnership, </em>TC Memo 1998-305 (absence of a nontax business purpose is fatal to the legitimate existence of a partnership). The Service was also successful in attacking an “abusive” arrangement, arguing that a purported interest in a partnership constituted a debt, thus causing a reallocation of income to the other partners; see <em>TIFD III-E, Inc., </em>2d Cir., 8/3/06, rev’g and rem’g <em>TIFD III-E, Inc., </em>342 FSupp2d 94 (DC CT 2004) <em>(Castle Harbour).</em> These cases are largely viewed as tax-shelter cases; the tax benefit obtained by the shift of taxable income to a nontaxable entity appears to have greatly influenced the court’s decision. Thus, it is unclear if the courts would rule the same absent the tax-shelter aspect. </p>\\r\\n<h3>What Is a Partnership Freeze?</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Typically, a closely held C corporation establishes a separate LLC/partnership with its shareholders. The shareholders may be family members or highly valued employees of a C corporation that contributes the bulk of the capital or a portion of its fixed assets to the venture and acts as the LLC/partnership’s manager. In exchange, the C corporation receives a “preferred” interest, in that it is entitled to certain profit allocations and cash distributions before they are received by the other partners. Allocations/distributions in excess of this “preferred” amount are generally capped or disproportionately small compared to the corporation’s capital contribution. The corporation’s interest is known as a “frozen” interest.<em> </em></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Shareholders, on the other hand, contribute relatively little capital to the venture and generally act as limited partners, with minimal involvement in management.<em> </em>In exchange, they receive “subordinated” profit allocations and cash distributions (because the corporation must first receive its preferential allocation). However, after the frozen interest receives its preference, the shareholders’ allocations of profits/cash are not capped or are disproportionately large relative to their capital contributions. Collectively, the shareholders’ interests are known as an “unfrozen” interest. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Assuming that the frozen partnership structure is respected by the IRS and the partnership is successful, the structure could reduce the tax liability associated with distributions of current earnings, and a majority of the subsequent appreciation of the business will avoid corporate-level tax. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Partnership-freeze transactions are subject to attack on various grounds, such as the disguised-sale provisions of Sec. 707, reallocation-of-income allocations under Sec. 482 as provided in Regs. Sec. 1.704-1(b)(1)(iii), partnership anti-abuse provisions under Regs. Sec. 1.701-2, valuation issues and the all-facts-and-circumstances analysis of <em>Culbertson, </em>337 US 733 (1949). The Second Circuit recently applied <em>Culbertson</em> in the <em>Castle Harbour</em> decision.</p>\\r\\n<h3><em>Castle Harbour </em></h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Three subsidiaries of General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) and two foreign banks (Dutch banks) organized Castle Harbour-I, LLC (Castle Harbour) for the business purpose of leasing aircraft to the airline industry. Through its three subsidiaries, GECC contributed several airplanes that were fully depreciated for tax purposes, but not for book purposes. The Dutch banks invested $117.5 million in the venture. Castle Harbour’s operations were effectively managed by GECC, while the Dutch banks had a minimal management role. The GECC entities could buy out the Dutch banks’ interest at any time for a nominal fee. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Castle Harbour was a self-liquidating partnership, because its operating agreement required the return of the Dutch banks’ invested capital plus a specified rate of return (minimum return) over a term of years. Based on the court’s decision, it is worthy to note that the minimum return was calculated to five decimal points (9.03587% or 8.53587%). To accomplish this, Castle Harbour Leasing Inc. (CHLI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Castle Harbour, was organized and required to hold cash essentially equal to 110% of the current value of the minimum return, ensuring that Castle Harbour would have the cash reserves needed to pay the minimum return. Additionally, GECC personally guaranteed the repayment. <em></em></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Due to a complex allocation regime and huge book depreciation deductions, 98% of Castle Harbour’s taxable income was allocated to the non-U.S.-taxpaying Dutch banks, even though their actual return was, for all practical purposes, limited to the minimum. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Court Decisions</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The Service challenged the venture on three grounds: the arrangement as a sham; the classification of the Dutch banks’ interest as equity; and the “overall tax effect.” The district court found in the taxpayer’s favor on all three accounts. The Second Circuit reversed the decision, relying on an application of the <em>Culbertson </em>totality-of-the-circumstances test. In <em>Culbertson</em>, the Supreme Court concluded that the parties’ intent should govern the determination of a partnership’s existence. To determine the parties’ intent and the existence of a business purpose, the Court stated that all of the circumstances surrounding the venture should be examined, including the operating agreement, the parties’ conduct while executing its provisions, their statements, the testimony of disinterested persons, the relationship of the parties, their respective abilities and capital contributions, the actual control of income and the purposes for which it was used, plus any other factors that might be helpful. <em></em></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Debt-equity analysis:</em></strong> In <em>Castle Harbour,</em> the court did not analyze any of the delineated <em>Culbertson </em>factors; instead, it used a debt-equity analysis to determine if the intent was to enter into a partnership or if the Dutch banks were simply secured lenders; see <em>Hambuechen, </em>43 TC 90 (1964) (holding that debt-equity criteria used in the corporate context should be applied in the partnership context), and Notice 94-47 (highlighting at least eight factors to consider in differentiating between an equity interest and a financing transaction). The Second Circuit applied Notice 94-47’s eight factors, plus a few of its own, to conclude that the Dutch banks were really lenders, as opposed to equity partners in <em>Castle Harbour.</em> </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Although the court examined all of the debt-equity factors, two primary factors motivated its decision. First and most important, the Dutch banks did not meaningfully share in the partnership’s business risks; they did not bear a significant risk of loss should the partnership incur losses. Repayment of the minimum return did not depend on the partnership’s operations, but was secured by CHLI’s required cash reserves and GECC’s personal guarantee. Second, the income-allocation scheme would not benefit the banks significantly, because the GECC entities could buy out the banks’ interest at any time for a nominal fee; as manager, GECC could effectively move any of the operational assets to CHLI, which would reduce the income allocated to the Dutch banks. Based on these factors, the court held that the banks looked more like secured creditors than equity participants in the partnership.  </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The court did point out that if the Dutch banks had a sufficiently sizable share in the LLC’s profit potential, they might be deemed equity participants for tax purposes, notwithstanding the guaranteed repayment of their initial investment at an agreed rate of return<em>. </em>However, it did not provide a definition of “sufficiently sizable.”</p>\\r\\n<h3>Effect on Partnership-Freeze Transactions</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The <em>Castle Harbour</em> decision, specifically, the framing of the debt-vs.-equity issue as a part of the <em>Culbertson</em> analysis, potentially raises significant concerns with respect to the issuance of the preferred return. In <em>Castle Harbour</em>, the relationship was recast as a debtor-creditor relationship; however, a similar conclusion in a partnership-freeze transaction would result in a sale transaction, with the corporation selling the assets to the partnership or partners in exchange for a debt instrument.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">To address (or, at minimum, take into account) the <em>Castle Harbour</em> decision in structuring a partnership freeze, tax advisers should address two primary issues: (1) a sufficiently sizable interest in profits should be created over and above the fixed preferred return and (2) the preferred interest, while protected, should be subject to a risk of loss.  </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Sufficiently sizable: </em></strong>Based on <em>Castle Harbour</em>, a partner must have a sufficiently sizable stake in the partnership’s operations. This is incredibly difficult to determine. Is a 1% or 2% interest sufficient? Or 5%? Does the answer change if the partner is actively involved in the partnership or is only a limited partner? In freeze transactions, the corporate “partner” generally receives a small percentage of the partnership’s profits after its initial preference, but is usually actively involved in its operations. Ultimately, practitioners have no clear guidance on “sufficiently sizable,” but <em>Castle Harbour</em> serves notice that the interest should be real, not merely on paper.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong><em>Risk of loss: </em></strong>Whether or not the court’s debt-vs.-equity analysis was appropriate, <em>Castle Harbour</em> is in line with <em>Culberston,</em> holding that if a putative partner contributes cash and receives a guarantee that the investment plus a specified rate of return will be paid, the partner is not meaningfully sharing in the partnership’s business risks. Thus, when structuring a freeze transaction, practitioners should avoid partner or partnership guarantees of return and investment, and should also be wary of agreements that maintain collateral to cover the investment and preference. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The laws defining a partnership and classifying partners are a little murky. The recent decision in <em>Castle Harbour</em> has made the waters a little murkier. Assuming that <em>Castle Harbour</em> will apply absent a tax shelter, practitioners should carefully consider the facts and circumstances surrounding a partnership freeze to determine whether the resulting partnership, each partner and the related allocations, will be respected. </p>\\r\\n</div>

When asked if he had any retirement savings, he answered that he had a small amount in a whole-life insurance policy. He also noted that he had very little in personal savings. Did he have any other investments? No. </p>\\r\\n<p>This client is not unique. The dilemma between funding college and retirement can be a difficult one. A parent’s first reaction is to provide for his or her child, so the child does not start out life burdened with debt, a very noble cause. In a perfect world, it would be wonderful to have sufficient savings to fund retirement fully and put money away for college. Often, however, a parent cannot afford to do both.</p>\\r\\n<p>If parents can save for only one of these goals, they should fund their retirement before paying for college, because there are very few ways to fund retirement, but many ways to pay for college. Put simply, money can be borrowed for college, but not for retirement.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Retirement Funding</h3>\\r\\n<p>Experts estimate that an individual will need to replace approximately 65% to 75% of pre-retirement income to maintain his or her current standard of living. Lower-income earners may need up to 90%. One-third of current retirees receive more than 90% of their income from Social Security; see Munnell and Soto, “How Much Pre-Retirement Income Does Social Security Replace?” Center for Retirement Research at Boston College Issue in Brief (No. 36, November 2005), available at <a href=\"http://crr.bc.edu/images/stories/Briefs/ib_36.pdf?phpMyAdmin=43ac483c4de9t51d9eb41\" target=\"_blank\">www.bc.edu/centers/crr/issues/ib_3d.pdf</a>.<strong> </strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Thus, the first question is, how much confidence does the client have that Social Security will be there on retirement? And, will it provide sufficient funds to maintain his or her current standard of living? With more and more companies no longer providing pension plans, the burden of funding retirement is squarely on the retiree’s shoulders. </p>\\r\\n<p>The main source of retirement funding will come from the retiree, either through a company-based Sec. 401(k) or 403(b) plan, the retiree’s own business (in the form of a savings incentive match plan for employees, a simplified employee pension or other qualified retirement plan) or through funding a regular or Roth IRA. Other funding sources are investments, including real estate, stocks, bonds, life insurance, deferred annuities and mutual funds. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Sources:</em></strong> In addition, an individual’s residence may be used to fund retirement. For example, New York real estate has increased tremendously in value over the last few years. A homeowner could sell his or her house and bank the proceeds for retirement. The problem with this strategy is timing; it will not work if retirement coincides with a down market in real estate. Also, the retiree needs to move somewhere else affordable. A New York retiree generally would have to move far away (or into a place smaller than the one previously owned) to gain any real benefit from selling. </p>\\r\\n<p>For the owner of a successful business, the needed retirement funds may be obtained by selling the business. Others may be counting on an inheritance or hoping to win the lottery. </p>\\r\\n<p>All in all, there are only a limited number of ways to fund retirement. Of course, the longer a person lives, the more he or she will need. The best asset in all of these opportunities is <em>time</em>. With the right planning and funding, the proper amount of retirement savings can be achieved. </p>\\r\\n<p>However, all of these options require retirement to be funded in some manner;<em> there are no borrowing options. </em>In funding college costs, many options are available to ensure that children are provided for.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Determining College Costs</h3>\\r\\n<p>The first step is to determine how much will be needed for college—the cost of attendance (COA). A parent should pick three colleges, with low, medium and high tuitions. Using the child’s age and a 7.8% college inflation rate (the amount of the average annual increase for public colleges and universities for the 2004–2005 school year), tuition costs can be reasonably determined; see “College Investing: Planning for your Child’s Future” (American Century Investments, 2005). The COA includes not only tuition, but also fees, room and board, books and supplies, personal computers, child care, transportation and personal expenses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Next to be determined is the expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC is the amount a family is expected to contribute to the child’s college education for one year. Typically, the lower the EFC, the more financial aid the child will receive. Factors such as family size, number of family members in college, family savings and current earnings (information found on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), available at www.fafsa.com) are used to calculate this figure. Once a FAFSA is processed, a family will receive a <br>\\r\\nStudent Aid Report with its official EFC “score.” College Answer (<a href=\"http://www.collegeanswer.com\">www.collegeanswer.com</a>) has a quick fill-in schedule that can be used to estimate this amount.</p>\\r\\n<p>COA, less the expected family contribution, equals financial need. In determining financial need, if a family’s income exceeds:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>$75,000, a child is unlikely to qualify for financial aid at most <em>public</em> universities. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p>$125,000, a child is unlikely to qualify for financial aid at most <em>private</em> universities. </p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>A key EFC strategy for maximizing financial aid involves limiting the assets in a child’s name, to avoid the child having more than $3,000 in income. This is because the child’s assets and income count much more heavily than the parents’, thereby increasing the EFC score and resulting in a lower financial-need amount, making it harder for the student to be eligible for most types of Federal, state and college financial aid.</p>\\r\\n<p>One of the most difficult discussions for parents is telling a child that they cannot afford a college that the child has chosen. However, parents must be realistic about how much they can spend for college without putting themselves deeply in debt. Parents who send a child to a college that is out of their price range risk being in debt for a long time; the money spent on college loans will not be available to invest for retirement. With people living longer and healthier lives, this may result in having to work much longer than anticipated.</p>\\r\\n<h3>FAFSA</h3>\\r\\n<p>Whether or not a child qualifies for financial aid, it is highly recommended that the FAFSA form be completed. Most other types of aid and loans also use this form. Although personal identification numbers (PINs) are optional, they may be used to save time and enable the FAFSA application to be processed and sent to the school’s financial-aid administrators much faster. PIN numbers may also be used to make corrections to the form online and to view Federal student-aid history online at the National Student Loan Data System (at www.nslds.ed.gov). The form can be submitted online or over the phone. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Gift Aid</h3>\\r\\n<p>The first option for college funding is gift aid—i.e., grants and scholarships that do not have to be paid back.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Federal Pell Grants: </em></strong>These are need-based grants; amounts are determined by the college based on EFC. To be considered, a FAFSA form must be filed. Information on Pell Grants, as well as other types of funding options, can be found at <a href=\"http://www.studentaid.ed.gov\">www.studentaid.ed.gov</a>. The grant will be in the student’s name, but go directly to the school. The college determines the amount; for the 2006–2007 school year, the minimum grant is $400, with a maximum of $4,050. An applicant’s EFC must be under $3,850 to qualify. Undergraduate students in four-year programs may receive Pell Grants for up to six years, if they are part-time students.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>FSEOGs: </em></strong>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOGs) are also need-based and are capped at $4,000 per year ($100 minimum). The college determines the amount of the grant based on the EFC.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Endowment funds: </em></strong>The child’s college of choice may offer grant/scholarship amounts derived from endowment funds or a tuition discount. These awards are given to merit, as well as need-based, students; the college determines the amount.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Other grants: </em></strong>Other grants and scholarships include the Academic Competitiveness Grant and the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant (National Smart Grant). The former is available for the first time for the 2006–2007 school year and is given in addition to a Pell Grant. The amounts range from $750 for the first year to $1,300 for the second year (undergraduate). The National Smart Grant is also in addition to a Pell Grant, and totals $4,000 for each of the third and fourth undergraduate years; for details, see <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/ac-smart.html\">www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/ac-smart.html</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>State grants: </em></strong>State grants vary. For example, the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is New York’s largest grant program. It helps eligible in-state residents attending in-state postsecondary institutions pay for tuition. TAP grants are up to $5,000, based on the applicant’s and family’s New York State net taxable income. Approximately three weeks after submitting a FAFSA, the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation will notify a candidate by postcard or e-mail that he or she can go to www.hesc.org, establish a PIN and complete the TAP application online.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Work-study programs: </em></strong>A school’s work-study program should be one of the first stops for a student. The funds awarded are administered by the college. Usually, the program consists of 8–15-hour workweeks at minimum wage. Individual states may also have work-study programs (implemented through colleges). Work-study programs are not included in the EFC formula.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Need-Based College Loans </h3>\\r\\n<p>There are two types of college loans: need-based and non-need-based. All Federal loans require a FAFSA form; all qualify for the Federal Loan Consolidation Program or hardship deferrals. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>FSSL: </em></strong>The Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan (FSSL) is in the student’s name; he or she will be entitled to the student-loan interest deduction. A FAFSA form needs to be filed; the loan will be part of the award letter from the college. FSSLs carry both a life and disability benefit on the student. Effective July 1, 2007, the loan amount is based on the year the student is entering college: $3,500 for freshmen; $4,500 for sophomores; $5,500 for juniors and seniors. A fifth year, if necessary, is capped at $4,000. Interest is paid (subsidized) by the Federal government until six months after the student leaves college. For loans disbursed before July 1, 2006, the interest rate is variable and adjusted once a year (on July 1). The interest rate on the repayment is capped at 8.25%. A 3% origination fee and a 1% insurance premium are subtracted from the loan proceeds. After July 1, 2006, the interest rate is fixed at 6.8% and the origination fee reduced to 2% for the 2006–2007 academic year; see Carpenter, “College Debt” (2006), at <a href=\"http://www.tuitionsolutionsnow.com/College%20Debt%20.pdf\">www.tuitionsolutionsnow.com/College%20Debt%20.pdf</a>.<strong> </strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The origination fees on the FSSL (as well as the Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan (FUSL), discussed below) phase out at half a point per year, until they are completely phased out in 2010.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>FPL: </em></strong>The Federal Perkins Loan (FPL) is also in the student’s name; he or she will be entitled to the student-loan interest deduction. A FAFSA form needs to be filed; the loan will be part of the award letter from the college. FPLs are low-interest, need-based loans with a 5% fixed rate. Students are eligible for up to $4,000 per year if undergraduate and $6,000 if graduate. The interest is subsidized by the Federal government until nine months after the student leaves college. The college determines which students will receive this loan and the amount.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Non-Need-Based College Loans</h3>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>FUSL: </em></strong>A FAFSA form must be filed and the student must file a financial aid application. The loan amount, interest rate and repayment terms are the same as for an FSSL, except that the interest is not subsidized by the Federal government while the student is in college. Repayment does not start until six months after the student leaves college.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Federal PLUS loans: </em></strong>Parents’ Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) are available only to parents or step-parents; a legal guardian will need permission from the school. These loans are not available to grandparents. A FAFSA form needs to be filed before applying. The amount available to a borrower is limited to the cost of attendance, less any financial aid awarded to the student. For loans disbursed before July 1, 2006, the interest rate is variable and adjusted once a year, on July 1; the interest rate on the repayment is capped at 9%. A 3% origination fee and a 1% insurance premium are taken from the loan proceeds. For loans disbursed after July 1, 2006, the interest rate is fixed at 8.5%; discounts on the rate may be available if the payments are made automatically from a checking account; see, e.g., Franklin and Marshall College, Financial Aid Office, PLUS Loan Application, at <a href=\"http://www.parentplusloan.com\">www.parentplusloan.com</a>. </p>\\r\\n<p>PLUS loans are 10-year loans, but may be consolidated into one loan and repaid over a 30-year period after the child leaves school. The loan balance is forgiven on the death or disability of the signatory parent. </p>\\r\\n<p>If a parent is not creditworthy and cannot obtain a PLUS loan, the student can borrow an additional $4,000 per year in FUSLs for the first year of college, and $5,000 for the second, third, fourth and fifth years of college (the limit for an independent student).</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Private education loans: </em></strong>Taxpayers should check with colleges for the terms and rates of these loans, which are set up with commercial lenders. <br>\\r\\nA listing of preferred lenders for <br>\\r\\nthe school can be obtained by either calling the school or going to its website.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>State loans: </em></strong>Some states offer their own loan programs (see, e.g., New Jersey’s program, at <a href=\"http://www.hesaa.org/\">www.hesaa.org/</a>).<strong> </strong></p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Other loans: </em></strong>Other alternative loans include those against real estate, margin accounts, life insurance and from employers and commercial lenders. The strategy of last resort is to borrow against retirement accounts. The ability to borrow against retirement plans is limited; borrowed funds must be repaid, with interest. While an individual cannot borrow from an IRA, Sec. 72(t)(2)(E) exempts distributions for college expenses from the 10% penalty.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Loan consolidation:</em> </strong>A consolidation loan is designed to help student and parent borrowers simplify loan repayment, by allowing the borrower to consolidate several types of Federal student loans with various repayment schedules into one loan. Even one loan can be converted into a consolidation loan, in order to get benefits (such as flexible repayment options). The interest rate on the consolidation loan may be lower than the rate currently being paid on one or more loans. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Saving for College</h3>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Sec. 529 plans: </em></strong>A Sec. 529 plan is a specific type of college savings plan. It is a tax-deferred way to save for college, by putting money into an account that, when used for qualified college costs, would be exempt from tax on its earnings. There are some restrictions on the amount that can be invested; a financial adviser or a certified college planning specialist should be consulted for information on the best options for investing in these plans.</p>\\r\\n<p>Are Sec. 529 plans the best option for college savings? The advantages include tax-deferred savings and tax-free distributions for college; in addition, contributions are completed gifts. There are tax benefits to investing in some state plans and, for high-income individuals, there are no income limits banning their investment in such plans. As for disadvantages, the account can lose money, investment selections are limited, state Medicaid agencies may require that plan assets be used to pay for medical and long-term care expenses before Medicaid payments start and, if plan amounts are not used for a qualified distribution, there is a 10% penalty on the earnings, and the earnings become taxable; see Hurley, <em>The Best Way to Save for College: A Complete Guide to 529 Plans </em>(<a href=\"http://www.Savingforcollege.com\">Savingforcollege.com</a> Publications, 2007).</p>\\r\\n<h3>Other Options </h3>\\r\\n<p>Are there other cost-efficient ways to fund college and retirement at the same time? There are several opportunities available to an investor that allow funds to be used for either college or retirement, depending on need.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Regular or Roth IRA: </em></strong>The advantage of using an IRA is that the funds are tax-deferred and can be distributed and used for college costs penalty-free (the holder is still taxed on the ordinary income, however). The disadvantage is that the amount contributed is limited to $4,000 per year (for 2007), provided the contributor has earned at least that much for the year. Also, if IRA funds are used for college, they are no longer available for retirement. If a student has earned income, a possible strategy is for the student to open an IRA and take an IRA deduction against that income. This strategy is not recommended if the student is eligible for financial aid.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Bonds: </em></strong>Investing in tax-exempt municipal bonds (triple-tax-free if invested in the investor’s state of domicile) and tax-deferred U.S. savings bonds (Series EE) gives the investor the flexibility of using the funds for either college or retirement. Using the interest from a municipal bond takes advantage of its tax-free status; if U.S. savings bonds are used for qualified higher education expenses (QHEEs), the income may be tax free under Sec. 135 (depending on the owner’s adjusted gross income (AGI)).</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Tax-efficient funds: </em></strong>Tax-efficient funds (such as index funds) are excellent long-term savings vehicles due to their low turnover, which reduces capital gains distributed over the investment’s life. This strategy is not recommended for a child eligible for financial aid. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Coverdell ESAs: </em></strong>Under Sec. 530, Coverdell education savings accounts (ESAs) are exempt from taxes if the amounts are used for QHEEs. The disadvantages are that a limited amount can be contributed each year ($2,000), contributions cannot be made after the beneficiary reaches age 18, the funds must be used before the beneficiary reaches age 30, contributions are phased out based on the contributor’s AGI (starting at $95,000 for an individual, $190,000 if filing jointly), and a 10% penalty is imposed on excess distributions over qualified expense amounts.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Mutual funds: </em></strong>The major advantage of using a mutual fund instead of a Sec. 529 plan is the flexibility of the fund’s use. It can be used for either college or retirement, with no penalty for distributing the funds. If a child receives a scholarship, grant or financial aid, the balance can be kept in the mutual fund and used for the child’s post-college needs. Other advantages include higher potential for investment performance, greater investment choices and lower fees. The major disadvantages are that distributions potentially result in capital gains, and dividends and capital gains earned each year are currently taxable.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Life insurance/annuities: </em></strong>Investing in a permanent life insurance policy, a group universal life insurance policy or an annuity is another way to fund retirement and (in the case of  insurance policies) ensure that insurance needs are covered with the same investment dollars. College planning comes into play with these types of investments, as these policies allow for loans or withdrawals. In many cases, however, withdrawals are subject to surrender charges that further erode the original investment’s value. For example, if $10,000 is needed for a child’s tuition and the contract has a 4% surrender charge, a total of $10,417 will need to be withdrawn. Borrowing from a life insurance contract entails loss of policy equity, and interest must be paid on the borrowed funds.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>UGMA/UTMA:</em> </strong>The major advantage of Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts is that income is realized by the minor beneficiary and will generally result in a lower tax expense for the family. However, the “kiddie tax” rules may apply in certain situations if the child is under age 18. This strategy would be used by families not eligible for financial aid. The major disadvantage of these types of accounts is that the minor will take control of the account at majority and can use the funds for anything. The child must be trustworthy enough to use the funds for college, if that was the intent when the account was established.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Sec. 2503(c) trust: </em></strong>A “minor’s trust” gives the trustee total discretion for the benefit of a minor before he or she turns 21. A financial adviser should be consulted before setting up one of these trusts.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Secs. 401(k) and 403(b): </em></strong>The strategy of last resort is to borrow from retirement accounts to fund college costs. Secs. 401(k) and 403(b) plans allow loans from the contributor’s account that usually need to be repaid over five years. The major disadvantage to such loans is that pretax dollars are being borrowed; these funds are not able to grow in their intended fashion, as the funds used for college are no longer being invested. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p>The funding dilemma between college and retirement is one of the most difficult for a parent. Proper planning and long-term thinking should be involved when parents sit down to discuss the options, given their financial and personal circumstances and needs. The general consensus is that parents should not sacrifice retirement savings for college. Once funds are used to pay for college, they no longer can work and grow. Not fully funding retirement is a risky strategy that should be done only after consideration of the severe long-term consequences.</p>\\r\\n<p><em>For further information about this column, contact Mr. Schulman at <a href=\"mailto:michael@schulmancpa.com\">michael@schulmancpa.com</a> or Mr. DeCandido at <a href=\"mailto:fjdcpa@si.rr.com\">fjdcpa@si.rr.com</a>.</em></p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

Miller, CPA</i></div>\\r\\n<p><strong>S</strong>earching the Internet under “innocent spouse relief” will turn up many organizations, CPAs, attorneys and others offering to assist a taxpayer with an innocent spouse claim. IRS Pub. 971, <em>Innocent Spouse Relief (And Separation of Liability and Equitable Relief),</em> explains the various types of relief, who may qualify and how to apply. Although the current innocent spouse rules under Sec. 6015 have been effective for determining unpaid balances due the IRS as of July 22, 1998 and Federal tax liabilities arising after that date, many cases have recently been decided by the Tax Court and district courts. </p>\\r\\n<p>In her 2006 annual report, Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate, included innocent spouse cases as among the most litigated; see <em>National Taxpayer Advocate’s 2006 Annual Report to Congress,</em> at <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/advocate/article/0,,id=165806,00.html\">www.irs.gov/advocate/article/0,,id=165806,00.html</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>An analysis of recent cases reveals that the Service interprets the rules as narrowly as possible. This is especially true of the “equitable” relief cases using Sec. 6015(f), which Congress intended for cases that do not fit the other two forms of innocent spouse protection: innocent spouse relief and relief by separation of liability. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Taxpayer Losses</h3>\\r\\n<p>The Tax Court has supported the IRS’s rulings against taxpayers in many equitable relief cases, including <em>Madden,</em> TC Memo 2006-4, <em>Motsko,</em> TC Memo 2006-17, and <em>Lopez,</em> TC Memo 2005-36. The Tax Court denied relief even though the taxpayers in the cases might suffer economic hardship.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRAHCA ’06) amended Sec. 6015 specifically to give the Tax Court jurisdiction to review innocent spouse cases claiming equitable relief and to suspend the statute of limitations while such claims are pending. This provision may change the dynamic in some of these cases.</p>\\r\\n<p>Until the TRAHCA ’06 was passed, Sec. 6015(e) gave taxpayers the option to petition the Tax Court to review denials of innocent spouse relief and relief by separation-of-liability cases, but not equitable relief cases. However, in Capehart, 11/7/06, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Tax Court properly determined the taxpayer was not eligible for Sec. 6015(b) relief from joint liabilities arising from tax shelter investments, because she played a substantial role in managing the investments in question. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Taxpayer Victories</h3>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Partial</strong></em>: Sometimes the taxpayer prevails in part. In <em>Levy,</em> TC Memo 2005-92, the court held that the IRS abused its discretion in denying the taxpayer Sec. 6015(f) equitable relief from joint liabilities for five years of understatements attributable solely to her ex-husband. The court found that although the taxpayer significantly benefited from unpaid liabilities and failed to show that she would suffer economic hardship if not granted relief, she had no knowledge or reason to know, at the time she signed the returns, that her ex-husband would not pay those tax liabilities. </p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Complete:</strong></em> Sometimes the taxpayer wins outright. In <em>Campbell,</em> TC Memo 2006-24, the court ruled that a nurse/homemaker was entitled to Sec. 6015(b) relief from over $2.8 million of liabilities attributable to her husband’s sham commodities-trading transaction. It was deemed highly inequitable to hold her liable, given her lack of knowledge, lowered standard of living, age and relatively modest assets. The court rejected the Service’s argument that the taxpayer misled by not fully disclosing account ownership. </p>\\r\\n<p>In <em>DeFore,</em> TC Summ. Op. 2004-162, a husband qualified for innocent spouse relief under Sec. 6015(c), despite having reason to know that his wife had understated her income. Proportionate relief was appropriate, as he was no longer married and did not have actual knowledge when signing the return of any of the items giving rise to the deficiency. Because the tax understatement was attributable entirely to the wife’s omitted income, the entire deficiency was allocated to her. </p>\\r\\n<p>In <em>Cook,</em> TC Memo 2005-22, the taxpayer qualified for innocent spouse relief under Sec. 6015(c), even though she prepared invoices for the omitted income. She had been subjected to physical and emotional abuse throughout her marriage. The court concluded that she lacked actual knowledge of the unreported income and qualified for relief from joint liability.</p>\\r\\n<p>Similarly, in <em>Neal,</em> TC Memo 2005-201, the taxpayer was held entitled to Sec. 6015(f) relief from joint liabilities. In <em>McClelland,</em> TC Memo 2005-121, the taxpayer was entitled to Sec. 6015(b) relief from liability for a deficiency arising from her and her husband’s false interest deduction. The court felt it would be inequitable under Sec. 6015(b)(1)(D) to hold her liable, because her husband had caused the false deduction and concealed it from her.</p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Overwhelming:</strong></em> Sometimes the taxpayer really wins. In <em>Owen,</em> TC Memo 2005-115, and <em>Bulger,</em> TC Memo 2005-147, the Tax Court held that a widowed taxpayer was entitled to reasonable administrative and litigation costs resulting from pursuit of a Sec. 6015(c) allocation claim for partial innocent spouse relief from joint partnership/tax-shelter-related liabilities. The IRS’s position, that the taxpayer did not qualify for allocation because of her alleged knowledge about items giving rise to deficiencies, was not substantially justified. The court held that the Service failed to apply a proper standard for evaluating actual knowledge, and did not investigate or account for the taxpayer’s detailed response indicating her lack of knowledge (which was bolstered by clear evidence that the partnership promoter had deceived all of the investors). </p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p>Claims for innocent spouse relief need to be very carefully and fully prepared before being sent to the IRS. The questions in Form 12507, Innocent Spouse Statement, should be used as a guide to determine whether a case has a reasonable chance of success. The answers should be prepared before Form 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse Relief (And Separation of Liability and Equitable Relief), is submitted. Form 12507 should not be submitted until the Service requests it.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<em>Mr. Miller is a member of the AICPA Tax Division’s IRS Practice &amp; Procedures Committee.

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClass2834C134AD574C23AA350C2129B4B06D><div class=ExternalClassEF3FBB1C6238499782207B271EC9BE3E>\\r\\n<div class=ExternalClassCF9F554C955F48C9A8D047FABA7FFA8C>\\r\\n<div class=SmallText><i>Editor: John L. Miller, CPA</i></div>\\r\\n<p>When filing 2006 corporate tax returns, many businesses will encounter new IRS requirements that significantly affect how they file. Some filers of Forms 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return, and 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, will be covered by phase two of a mandatory Service electronic-filing (e-filing) program, while others will wrestle with preparing to file a Schedule M-3, Net Income (Loss) Reconciliation for Corporations With Total Assets of $10 Million or More, for the first time. Even veterans who successfully e-filed last year’s corporate returns and mastered Schedule M-3 will have to adjust to changes in the e-filing transition rules and the requirement to provide additional information with that schedule.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Original Corporate E-File Mandate</h3>\\r\\n<p>Last year, taxpayers with assets of $50 million or more that filed Form 1120 or 1120S, and also filed 250 “other” returns, were required to e-file their corporate income tax forms. (The 250 “other” returns include income, excise and employment taxes, and information returns such as Forms W-2 and 1099.) Taxpayers covered by the mandate used Modernized E-File (MeF), a new IRS filing program, which requires all taxpayers to submit their return data via a single extensible-markup-language (XML)-based electronic transmission.</p>\\r\\n<p>Many taxpayers found it a challenge to change from traditional return preparation processes to the new e-filing environment. Corporate tax return preparation has always involved retrieving data from multiple sources and systems within a company. Assembling the actual return usually entailed melding data from several separate systems, some derived from return preparation software and some delivered on spreadsheets, Word documents or third-party transaction documents. </p>\\r\\n<p>The new IRS system requires that all return data (regardless of source) be translated into XML format. Taxpayers may have to modify their internal work processes to ensure that data from their international operations, asset management systems or investment portfolios correctly finds its way into their chosen return preparation software.</p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Phase one successful:</strong></em> The first phase of the Service’s corporate electronic mandate was deemed a success. Over 500,000 Forms 1120 and 1120S were processed by the MeF system last year, with mandated returns accounting for 14,000 of the total. Much of the initial success can be traced to the IRS’s active engagement of affected taxpayers, return preparers, software vendors and practitioner groups. The AICPA’s IRS Practice &amp; Procedures Committee met regularly with major software vendors and senior Service personnel to identify and address potential problems, leading to a series of transition options that removed obstacles to the e-filing program. Among the most important options were those allowing certain forms to be filed as .pdf documents rather than XML; provided paper or .pdf alternatives for key international forms (Forms 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect To Certain Foreign Corporations; 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business; 5713, International Boycott Report; 8858, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Foreign Disregarded Entities; and 8865, Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships; and their associated schedules); and authorized summary-level data for certain high-volume transactional forms. </p>\\r\\n<p>Because of some first-year system limits, the IRS also agreed that certain fact patterns would result in a waiver; some corporate forms (Forms 1120-F, U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation; 1120-FSC, U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Sales Corporation; 1120-RIC, U.S. Income Tax Return for Regulated Investment Companies; and 1120-REIT, U.S. Income Tax Return for Real Estate Investment Trusts) were excluded from e-filing.</p>\\r\\n<h3>2006 Return Requirements</h3>\\r\\n<p>For tax year 2006, the mandate expanded to filers of Forms 1120 and 1120S that have assets of $10 million or more and file 250 “other” returns. In October 2006, Large and Mid-Size Business Commissioner Deborah Nolan notified those corporations that, based on the assets reflected on their last return, they were required to e-file under the expanded mandate. </p>\\r\\n<p>Some taxpayers in this second wave of mandated filers may encounter challenges because of the small size of their tax staffs. In an October 2006 KPMG/Tax Executive Institute survey of tax directors whose corporations filed mandated 2005 returns, 88% said they had incurred either modest or substantial additional compliance costs. Not surprisingly, a majority of the additional expense related to the purchase, training and support costs associated with return-preparation software. For many of those corporations, the costs might have run even higher had their tax departments not had access to in-house technology support for installing and using the software; 86% of the respondents had internal information technology resources to draw on.</p>\\r\\n<p>The IRS has narrowed the transition options for the second year of the mandate; improvements to both Service systems and commercially available software have reduced the need for some exceptions. For 2006, fewer .pdf forms will be allowed; paper or .pdf alternatives for filing 2005 international forms have been eliminated. A transition option will continue to allow summary data to be entered for certain high-volume transactional forms. Also, in response to privacy concerns expressed by corporate tax directors, the IRS will permit corporate filers to complete Schedule E, Compensation of Officers, without including officers’ names and Social Security numbers; see <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=163357,00.html\">www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=163357,00.html</a>, Section 3.</p>\\r\\n<p>Another significant change for 2006 returns is that a taxpayer may e-file more than one return. Unlike last year (when only one electronic return per taxpayer was permitted), a taxpayer filing an initial 2006 return and then filing a subsequent (superseding) return before the original or extended due date must now e-file both returns; the same applies for amended returns. (For a discussion of superseding returns, see Keenan, Tax Practice &amp; Procedures, “Superseding Return Filed on Extended Due Date Starts SOL,” p. 236, this issue.)</p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Waivers:</strong></em> For taxpayers that do not believe they can comply with the e-file mandate, Temp. Regs. Sec. 301.6011-5T provides an opportunity to request a waiver. The taxpayer must demonstrate that either undue hardship or technology issues prevent it from e-filing. The IRS provided detailed instructions for documenting the waiver request in Notice 2005-88. In discussions that preceded the 2005 return filings, the Service predicted that few waivers would be needed or approved, because the transition options would eliminate most significant obstacles. Only 113 waivers were granted for the 2005 tax year, with 48 of those related to entities filing their last required return. The IRS generally did not approve a waiver request if the software purchased or licensed by a taxpayer or preparer did not include all of the features needed to comply with the MeF requirements, taking the position that compliant software is available in the marketplace and taxpayers are expected to obtain it. </p>\\r\\n<p>Tax Year 2006 Directions for Corporations Required to e-file is an especially useful reference for taxpayers and tax advisers, available at <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=163357,00.html\">www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=163357,00.html</a>. The Service’s website also houses a comprehensive set of continuously updated frequently asked questions. The AICPA’s IRS Practice &amp; Procedures Committee has prepared a presentation that can be downloaded from the AICPA website; visit <a href=\"/InterestAreas/Tax/Resources/CorporationsandShareholders/Pages/default2.aspx\">http://tax.aicpa.org/Resources/Corporations+and+Shareholders/</a> and click on “AICPA PowerPoint on IRS Mandatory Corporate E-File Program.”</p>\\r\\n<h3>Expanded Schedule M-3 Filing Requirements for 2006 Returns</h3>\\r\\n<p>Schedule M-3 must be filed by corporations and partnerships with $10 million or more in assets, and by certain other partnerships. Filers of Forms 1120-PC, U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance Company Income Tax Return; 1120-L, U.S. Life Insurance Company Income Tax Return; 1120S; and 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, are required to include Schedule M-3 with their 2006 returns. Cooperative associations filing new Form 1120-C, U.S. Income Tax Return for Cooperative Associations, must file a Form 1120, Schedule M-3, if they report total assets of $10 million or more.</p>\\r\\n<p>Schedule M-3 currently contains a line for entities to report any book-tax difference arising from the cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) deduction. However, in pursuit of more detail on how entities compute the deduction, the IRS created Form 8916-A, Reconciliation of Cost of Goods Sold Reported on Schedule M-3, which requires a breakdown of the COGS deduction (e.g., amounts attributable to cost-flow assumptions; book vs. tax inventory computations; inventory shrinkage accruals; and amounts attributable to Sec. 263A costs). The latter must be further broken down into expense items, such as stock option expense, meals and entertainment expense, deferred compensation and depreciation. </p>\\r\\n<p>Because many companies do not keep records that separately account for the component parts of the COGS deduction, and may be unaware of the new requirement, affected taxpayers will struggle to prepare the form properly during the next filing season.  </p>\\r\\n<em>Mr. Miller is a member of the AICPA Tax Division’s IRS Practice &amp; Procedures Committee.

Miller, CPA</i></div>\\r\\n<p><strong>T</strong>he general statute of limitations (SOL) for assessment found in Sec. 6501 gives the IRS three years to assess tax after a return has been filed, beginning on the date that a valid Federal tax return is deemed filed. A return filed prior to the deadline is deemed filed on the due date. A return filed on extension is deemed filed on the day the Service actually receives the return, provided it is received on or before the extended due date; if the return is received after that date, it is deemed filed on the postmark date.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sometimes a taxpayer receives an extension to file a Federal tax return, but files before the extended due date. The taxpayer then files a second return, also before the extended due date, changing data reported on the originally filed return. This situation triggers a question—which return constitutes “the return” for assessment SOL purposes?</p>\\r\\n<h3>Effect of a Timely Filed Amended Return</h3>\\r\\n<p>A second tax return filed before the return due date that changes data reported on an original return is commonly referred to as a “superseding” tax return. The seminal case in the area is <em>Haggar</em> <em>Co.,</em> 308 US 389 (1940), in which the taxpayer was required to declare the value of stock, for purposes of a now-obsolete capital stock tax, on its “first return.” The taxpayer reported the par value of its stock on a timely filed return, then filed an amended return before the extended due date to declare the stock’s actual value. Noting that the government was not prejudiced and that there was a long-standing administrative practice of accepting timely amended returns in other contexts, the Supreme Court held that “[a] timely amended return is as much a ‘first return’…as a single return filed by the taxpayer.” </p>\\r\\n<p><strong><em>Effect of </em>Haggar:</strong> The principle underlying the Court’s holding in <em>Haggar</em> has been extended and applied in court decisions and by the IRS in administrative rulings. For example, in <em>National Lead Co.,</em> 336 F2d 134 (2d Cir. 1964), the taxpayer elected for tax year 1950 to use the LIFO inventory replacement provision in the 1939 Code; under this provision, the election was irrevocable. Prior to the election deadline, the taxpayer notified the Service that it was revoking the election. The Second Circuit cited <em>Haggar</em> as authority for the proposition that an election can be validly revoked within the time allowed for making it, and held that the taxpayer properly revoked it. The court reasoned that the government was in no way disadvantaged by the result, because the final election was made within the time specified in the law (see also <em>Matheson</em>, 74 TC 836 (1980) (election to deduct disaster loss); Rev. Rul. 56-67 (election to file consolidated return was revocable by filing separate returns before due date); and IRS Letter Rulings 8939054 (consent to revoke election under Section 10202(e)(3)(A) of the Revenue Act of 1987) and 8526074 (consent to revoke Sec. 83(b) election if requested within 30-day period for making such election)).</p>\\r\\n<h3>Superseding Returns and the SOL</h3>\\r\\n<p>In recent Chief Counsel Advice (CCA) 200645019, the IRS concluded that a taxpayer’s superseding tax return filed on the extended due date is the return that starts the assessment SOL. </p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Facts:</strong></em> On March 15, 2003, the taxpayer timely mailed Form 7004, Application for Automatic 6-Month Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns, requesting an extension to Sept. 15, 2003 to file Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return. Before that date, the taxpayer filed Forms 1120 and 1139, Corporation Application for Tentative Refund. These forms reflected a tax overpayment and requested a refund. Form 1120 included only basic income tax information and schedules; the taxpayer did not include any of the required Forms 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect To Certain Foreign Corporations.</p>\\r\\n<p>On Sept. 15, 2003, the taxpayer mailed a second Form 1120 for the 2002 tax year, which included different information from the original return and requested an additional refund on a second Form 1139. The taxpayer attached Forms 5471 to the second Form 1120. </p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Analysis:</strong></em> The Service first addressed whether the filing of Form 1120 before Sept. 15, 2003 revoked the remaining extension to file granted until that date. Based on <em>Haggar,</em> it concluded that the taxpayer’s filing of a first return before Sept. 15, 2003 did not revoke the remaining extension.</p>\\r\\n<p>Second, the IRS addressed whether the taxpayer’s original Form 1120 or the superseding one started the three-year assessment SOL. It concluded that the taxpayer’s superseding tax return filed on Sept. 15, 2003 was the valid return for the tax period; thus, the superseding return started the assessment SOL.</p>\\r\\n<p>Third, the Service addressed whether the Sec. 6038(b) penalty applied to the Forms 5471 attached to the subsequent filing on Sept. 15, 2003, as late-filed information returns. Under Sec. 6038, a U.S. taxpayer that owns a controlling interest in a foreign business entity is required to furnish certain information on Form 5471 with its Federal tax return. Failure to comply subjects the taxpayer to certain penalties under Sec. 6038(b). However, the application to extend the filing deadline of the taxpayer’s return also extended the deadline for Form 5471. </p>\\r\\n<p><em><strong>Holding:</strong></em> Because the return filed on Sept. 15, 2003 was the taxpayer’s return for the tax period, the IRS concluded that the Forms 5471 attached to that return were timely filed.</p>\\r\\n<em>Mr. Miller is a member of the AICPA Tax Division’s IRS Practice &amp; Procedures Committee.

As of the end of year 1, <em>X</em> has a fixed liability to pay compensation for services provided by its employees during year 1. As of the end of that year, all events have occurred to establish <em>X’</em>s liability for the taxes owed under Secs. 3111 (the employer’s share of FICA taxes) and 3301 (FUTA taxes) and the amount of the payroll tax liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy. <em>X</em> properly adopted the recurring-item exception under Regs. Sec. 1.461-5 as a method of accounting for the payroll taxes. <em>X</em> pays the payroll taxes either (1) in year 1 or (2) before the earlier of September 15 of year 2 or the date <em>X</em> files a timely (including extensions) Federal income tax return for year 1. Thus, under Sec. 461, the payroll taxes generally would be treated as incurred by <em>X</em> in year 1. However, the compensation to which the payroll taxes relate is deferred compensation properly deductible under Sec. 404 in year 2.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Sec. 404 </h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In general, compensation is deductible under Sec. 404 if it is paid or accrued under a deferred-compensation plan. However, an employer’s payroll tax liability is not compensation. Thus, Sec. 404 does not control the deductibility of <em>X’</em>s payroll tax liability, even though it relates to a deferred-compensation liability subject to Sec. 404, nor does it alter the timing of the accrual of such payroll tax liability under Sec. 461.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Sec. 461</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Regs. Sec. 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) provides that, under the accrual method, a liability is incurred, and generally taken into account for Federal income tax purposes, in the tax year in which (1) all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, (2) the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy and (3) economic performance has occurred as to the liability (the all-events test). </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">For a payroll tax liability, Regs. Sec.1.461-4(g)(6) provides generally that economic performance occurs as the tax is paid to the governmental authority that imposed it. However, Regs. Sec. 1.461-5(b)(1) provides a recurring-item exception to the general rule of economic performance. Under that exception, a liability is treated as incurred for a tax year if (1) at the end of the tax year, all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability and the amount can be determined with reasonable accuracy; (2) economic performance occurs on or before the earlier of (i) the date that the taxpayer files a return (including extensions) for the tax year or (ii) the 15th day of the ninth calendar month after the close of the tax year; (3) the liability is recurring in nature; and (4) either the amount of the liability is not material or accrual of the liability in the tax year results in better matching of the liability against the income to which it relates than would result from accrual of the liability in the tax year in which economic performance occurs. Under Regs.

Rul. 69-587, 1969-2 CB 108, concluded that, under the all-events test of Sec. 461, an accrual-method employer generally may not deduct payroll taxes payable for bonuses and vacation pay accrued, but unpaid, at year end until the tax year in which they are paid. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Rev. Rul. 96-51, 1996-2 CB 36, held that, under the all-events test, an accrual- method employer may deduct in year 1 its payroll taxes for year-end wages properly accrued in year 1, but paid in year 2, provided the employer satisfies the requirements of the recurring-item exception in Regs. Sec. 1.461-5. However, Rev. Rul. 96-51 did not address the application of Sec. 404, because the year-end wages were paid before the 15th day of the third calendar month after the end of year 1. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Holding </h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Rev.

Ellentuck, Esq.</i></div>\\r\\n<p><strong>I</strong>ncome in respect of a decedent (IRD) generally consists of items of gross income a decedent was entitled to at death that, because of the decedent’s method of accounting, were not included in the final individual return; see Regs. Sec. 1.691(a)-1(b). IRD is included in a decedent’s assets on the estate tax return and, when received, is includible in the income of the person or entity acquiring the right to receive it (i.e., the beneficiary). Some of the more common items that may be IRD include interest and dividend income from an S corporation’s investments and income from installment sales made by an S corporation. Further, a cash-method professional practice will always have IRD in the form of its accounts receivable, as these represent an asset to the decedent and are also income under the cash method of accounting when subsequently collected.</p>\\r\\n<h3>S Stock Issues</h3>\\r\\n<p>A person acquiring S stock from a decedent treats as IRD his or her pro-rata share of income items that would have been IRD had the items been acquired directly from the decedent. To mitigate the fact that the income has been included in the estate and is taxable to the beneficiary as well, the beneficiary deducts the Federal estate tax attributable to the IRD as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, not subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income (AGI) limit; see Sec. 691(c).</p>\\r\\n<h3>Example</h3>\\r\\n<p>Robert owns 50% of the shares of Rib, Inc., a calendar-year S corporation. Rib is on the cash basis and holds a $400,000 note receivable that bears interest at 10%, payable annually. Robert died on Dec. 31, 2005, the day before the $40,000 annual interest payment was due. The $40,000 of interest accrued but not paid at Robert’s death is IRD.</p>\\r\\n<p>Wanda inherits Robert’s Rib stock, and for the year ended Dec. 31, 2006, Rib passes through $20,000 ($40,000 × 50%) of interest income received on the note to her. Robert’s estate paid $7,000 additional estate tax because the $20,000 accrued interest was included on his estate tax return. Wanda reports the $20,000 as interest income on her Form 1040 and deducts the $7,000 on Schedule A under “Other Miscellaneous Deductions” (not subject to the 2%-of-AGI limit).</p>\\r\\n<h3>Basis</h3>\\r\\n<p>The stepped-up basis in S stock acquired from a decedent is reduced to the extent the stock’s value is attributable to items consisting of IRD, under Sec. 1367(b)(4). The accumulated adjustments account is also reduced by the IRD items. </p>\\r\\n<strong><em>Planning tip:</em></strong> Sec. 1367(b)(4)(B) states that the basis of inherited S stock is reduced by “the portion of the value of the stock which is attributable to items constituting income in respect of the decedent.” This does not necessarily mean that basis is reduced dollar-for-dollar by IRD if it can be established that the presence of IRD does not increase the stock’s overall value, dollar-for-dollar. Thus, the stock’s value should be determined twice—once with the IRD items included in the calculation and once with the IRD items excluded. The difference between the two calculations yields the portion of the value of the stock attributable to IRD items.\\r\\n<p><em>This case study has been adapted from PPC’s Tax Planning Guide—S Corporations, 20th Edition, by Andrew R.

If claimants who take a structured settlement later realize that they need some or all of the funds earlier than scheduled, they may turn to a factoring company. Factoring occurs under an agreement between the claimant (i.e., the payee) and a third party. The payee usually assigns future payment rights to a factoring company in return for a lump sum. Subsequently, the payer of the annuity continues making periodic payments, but to the factoring company.</p>\\r\\n<p>Factoring companies are not insurance companies, nor do they issue annuities. However, some insurance companies are entering the factoring business. If an insurance company factors periodic payments under an annuity it issued, this is not factoring, but rather, “commuting.” </p>\\r\\n<p>Commuting is similar to factoring, in that the payee receives a lump sum for giving up future periodic payments. However, in a commutation, the payee is not paid by a third party. From a payee’s viewpoint, factoring and commuting both produce cash, but the factual differences are significant. Although these two vehicles may both get cash to the payee, it is unclear whether an insurance company can commute periodic payments under its own annuity policy and still comply with Federal income tax law. </p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Periodic Payments</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>A structured settlement begins with a tax-free personal physical injury or workers’ compensation recovery. The plaintiff may want a structure to control spending, conserve assets or enhance eligibility for public benefits. Because structuring a settlement also makes otherwise-taxable interest tax free, the tax benefits alone can be enormous. </p>\\r\\n<p>Mechanically, the defendant assigns its obligation to make periodic payments (a qualified assignment) to a third party (the qualified assignee), by paying it a lump sum. The qualified assignee purchases an annuity to fund the periodic payments, often from a related insurance company. Although the qualified assignee receives a lump sum, this payment is not included in its gross income (up to the purchase price of the funding annuity), provided several requirements are met. </p>\\r\\n<p>Perhaps most important, under Sec. 130(c)(2)(B), the periodic payments cannot be accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased by the recipient. Settlement agreements and qualified assignment and annuity contracts often contain anti-assignment clauses designed to prohibit payees from assigning rights to receive future periodic payments to third parties. Although the enforceability of anti-assignment clauses is beyond this item’s scope, such clauses typically do not prevent a payee from factoring, especially if the transfer or assignment is approved by a court order issued under an applicable state transfer statute. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Excise Tax </h3>\\r\\n<p>While no Code sections specifically regulate commutations, Sec. 5891 levies a 40% excise tax on certain structured-settlement factoring transactions. </p>\\r\\n<p>To avoid the excise tax, the factoring transaction must be approved by a “qualified order,” defined by Sec. 5891(b)(2) as a final order, judgment or decree finding that the transfer of structured-settlement payment rights does not contravene any statute. (Many state laws also require court orders before structured settlements can be factored or commuted.) In addition, the periodic payments must be (1) fixed and determinable, and not accelerated, deferred, increased or decreased by the recipient (per Sec. 130(c)(2)(A) and (B)); and (2) payable by a person who is a party to the suit, agreement or workers’ compensation claim, or by a person who has assumed the liability for these periodic payments under a qualified assignment in accordance with Sec. 130.<a>1</a></p>\\r\\n<p>Because payments in a factoring transaction do not change and the annuity remains outstanding, it is generally accepted that these payments meet Sec. 130(c)(2)’s requirements. However, when an issuer commutes its own annuity, it makes no further payments. </p>\\r\\n<p>From the payee’s perspective, both factoring and commuting arguably involve acceleration, because in either event, the payee receives funds earlier than specified. From the issuer’s perspective, an acceleration arguably occurs only in a commutation; it continues to make scheduled annuity payments after a factoring. From the qualified assignee’s perspective, a commutation is arguably an acceleration, while factoring is not. The qualified assignee is the annuity’s legal owner and has the right and power to change its terms.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Timing</h3>\\r\\n<p>Another matter is timing. If Sec. 130 was met when the structured settlement was entered into, subsequent factoring does not affect it (i.e., the qualified assignee’s Sec. 130 tax break is not affected by later factoring). It is unclear whether a subsequent commutation fares as well. Even if a commutation does not trigger an excise tax, an “acceleration” could violate Sec. 130, particularly if the time between issuance and commutation is minimal. </p>\\r\\n<p>For example, if an issuer commutes an annuity in close proximity to the qualified assignment, it might be deemed to have had a prearranged plan to commute. If it contacts all payees receiving periodic payments and actually solicits the commutation of its own annuities, this could conceivably invoke constructive-receipt issues for payees, even if they must meet some requirement to receive the money. </p>\\r\\n<p>Of course, focusing unduly on timing should not obscure the fact that <em>any </em>acceleration (increase, deferral, etc.) is contrary to Sec. 130. Still, if an insurance company offers to issue structured-settlement annuities and simultaneously seeks to commute them, is the commutation bona fide (even without an express link between a particular issuance and a particular commutation)? It seems hard to reconcile this with Sec. 130’s “no acceleration” mandate.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Court Order Ramifications </h3>\\r\\n<p>To avoid the excise tax, an acquirer of structured-settlement payment rights must obtain a final order, judgment or decree of a state court or responsible administrative authority ruling that the transfer-of-payment rights do not contravene any Federal or state statute, or the order of any court or responsible administrative authority. Under Sec. 5891(b)(5), this qualified order is “dispositive” for purposes of avoiding the excise tax. </p>\\r\\n<p>Although such an order plainly means no excise tax, it probably means no more than that. Under traditional Federal income tax principles, a ruling by a state or Federal court is not binding on the Service or the courts.<a>2</a><a> </a>When trial courts rule that a payment has particular tax consequences, the IRS often disagrees.<a>3</a> Even a trial court’s ostensibly factual findings (e.g., that a plaintiff’s recovery is for personal physical injuries) are not binding on the Service or the courts.<a>4</a> A court ruling that no statute is violated—a precondition to avoiding the excise tax—surely cannot, by itself, determine for Federal tax purposes that an assignment qualifies under Sec. 130. </p>\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\n<p>Although the Code appears to permit factoring, there is no clear answer as to whether annuity issuers can commute payments due under their own policies without adverse tax consequences. Considering Sec. 130’s ban on acceleration, deferral, increase and decrease, factoring and commuting seem different. Factoring does not violate these four requirements, while commuting seems to. </p>\\r\\n<p>If issuers risk violating Sec. 130 when they commute their own annuities (with or without a qualified order under Sec. 5891), the consequences could be quite severe. Without Sec. 130, the assignment company could face a crushing tax mismatch, paying tax on the initial payment it receives to fund the annuity, but deducting payments to the payee only over time. Until this issue is clarified, this is a risk that seems too big to take. </p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</div>

AICPAPageContent:SW|<div class=ExternalClass47BDF21724A54973917485B497F45DE7><div class=SmallText><i>Co-Editors: Michael Metz, CPA; Nick Gruidl, CPA, MBT</i></div>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>A</strong>s the mergers and acquisitions market continues to heat up, so should the scrutiny of sales tax in the due diligence review. Unlike income tax, sales tax is transaction-based and applies to sales, regardless of whether the company is in a profit or a loss position. A company can be financially sunk by a significant and unforeseen sales tax assessment. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A buyer of a company should be aware that sales tax successor liability generally applies to the purchase of a business, even an asset purchase. A due diligence review can reduce the surprises and, in some circumstances, enhance negotiations for a reduced sale price.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Nexus and Tax Exemptions</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">The biggest sales tax exposures generally result from a failure to (1) register and collect tax in a state and (2) collect tax based on an erroneous decision that the receipts are not subject to tax. Many companies are caught off guard by inquiries from distant states and are surprised at the low nexus standards for sales tax. “Nexus” is defined simply as the minimum connection or physical presence that must exist before a state can impose tax liability and reporting requirements on a company. The Supreme Court ruled in <em>Quill v. North Dakota,</em> 504 US 29 (1992), that a “physical presence” exists by the temporary presence of property, inventory, employees or independent representatives in a state.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">However, states vary in interpreting the degree of physical presence required. For example, 11 visits to Kansas during three months of a four-year audit period were insufficient to establish nexus; see <em>In the Matter of Appeal of Intercard,</em> 270 Kan. 346 (Kan. 2000). Arizona concluded that the presence of employees in the state for more than two days a year establishes nexus; see Arizona Dep’t of Rev., Pub. 623, <em>Nexus in Arizona,</em> May 2006. “Nexus with Texas” can be established by a single day’s visit to the state by either an employee or an agent. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Generally, a target company with sales representatives promoting its products across the country has established nexus in most states. If that company has not registered with the states and reported sales tax, it potentially owes sales tax, interest and penalties for past years on taxable sales in those states. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Another common error is mistakenly concluding that the sale of a product or service is exempt from sales tax. Sales tax determinations can be challenging for the advanced business models of many target companies; mixed transactions involving the sale of services and tangible personal property are particularly prone to error. As with nexus, failure to collect tax can result in significant exposure for tax, interest and penalties.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A due diligence review can expose other common errors, such as failure to properly document exempt transactions, accrue use tax on purchases and collect tax at the correct rate. By developing and following a thorough due diligence plan, the buyer can uncover these and other significant sales tax issues.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Possibility of Mitigation</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">After receiving the “parade of horribles” from the buyer, a target may have the opportunity to mitigate the liability. First, the seller should closely review the basis for the buyer’s nexus, taxability and other determinations. In many cases, the conclusions are not certain; arguments can be made to support a position that favors the seller. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">When taxability or nexus is conceded, the potential liability can be mitigated by a customer’s exempt status. For example, some states provide an exemption for sales to a reseller. Sales to the U.S. government are always exempt, and most states provide an exemption for sales to the state and its subdivisions. In addition, a use by the customer can also be exempt; for example, many states provide an exemption for equipment used in the manufacturing process.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Potential exposure can be mitigated by use taxes that the customer self-reported to the state or by collecting use tax from the customer. If the target sells to only a few large companies regularly audited by the state, it is quite likely that the customer either accrued the tax or paid it on audit. On the other hand, if the sales were to individuals, there is little chance of recouping the tax. </p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Liability may also be mitigated by the opportunity to enter into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state. If a taxpayer approaches a state with its tax liabilities, the latter is likely to waive penalties and reduce the number of years under review. For example, Utah has formalized voluntary disclosure programs that significantly reduce liability. This option should be taken in consideration of other potential liabilities (such as state income and payroll taxes).</p>\\r\\n<h3>Structuring a Deal</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Sales tax should also be considered when structuring the deal itself. Sales tax does not generally apply to a transfer of assets pursuant to a stock purchase or statutory merger; however, asset sales are subject to tax in some states. For example, California sales tax applies to the sale of capital assets if the seller is engaged in a business that requires holding a seller’s permit if more than two sales are made in a 12-month period. In <em>Hotel Del Coronado v. State Board of Equalization,</em> 15 Cal. App.3d 612 (1971), the court held that a hotel was required to hold a seller’s permit because it made 12 (seemingly insignificant) salvage sales of old furniture during the audit period. California’s “occasional sale” exemption is narrow in application, causing many asset sales in that state to be subject to sales tax.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Unlike California, many states provide an occasional sale (or “isolated sale”) exemption that includes the sale of assets not customarily sold by the taxpayer. Some states, such as Texas, provide an exemption for the sale in a single transaction of the entire operating assets of a business or of a separate division, branch or identifiable segment of a business; see TX Tax Code Section 151.304(b)(2). Unlike the conclusion in <em>Hotel Del Coronado,</em> many states would not impose tax on the transaction, because the sale would qualify for a (much broader) occasional-sale exemption.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">In states that impose tax on asset sales, the potential sales tax liability should be considered in light of other factors driving the form of the sale. The transaction would not be subject to California sales tax if it took the form of a stock purchase or merger.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Successor Liability</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">A buyer should carefully review the potential for sales tax successor liability. Many states impose successor liability for sales tax even if the buyer purchases the business’s assets. Some states also have “bulk sale notifications” that need to be considered.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Summary</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Sales tax liability can be a significant factor in the sale or purchase of a business enterprise. Generally, the key concern is the failure to collect sales tax from customers. The potential exposure can be mitigated by carefully reviewing customers’ exemption status, the likelihood that customers self-reported (or would pay) the tax and voluntary disclosure opportunities with the state.</p>\\r\\n</div>

Part I of this article, in the March 2007 issue, focused on nexus, Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sec. 338(h)(10) transactions, allocable/apportionable income and tax base. Part II, below, covers some of the more important developments in apportionment formulas, unitary groups/filing methods, administration and other significant corporate state tax issues.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Apportionment</h3>\\r\\n<p>A multistate corporation’s business income is apportioned among the states using an apportionment percentage for each state having jurisdiction to tax the corporation. To determine the apportionment percentage, a ratio is established for each of the factors included in the state’s formula. Each ratio is calculated by comparing the corporation’s level of a specific activity in the state to the total corporation activity of that type everywhere; the ratios are then summed, weighted (if required) and averaged to determine the corporation’s apportionment percentage for the state. The apportionment percentage is then multiplied by total corporation business income.</p>\\r\\n<p>While apportionment formulas vary, many states use a three-factor formula that includes sales, payroll and property. Because use of a higher-weighted sales factor generally provides tax relief for in-state corporations, most states accord more weight to the sales factor than to the other factors. Changes in the apportionment formula may also be used to provide relief or tax benefits to specific industries or to reflect properly the operations of a particular industry. Recent apportionment developments are summarized below.</p>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Increased Weighting of Sales Factor</h5>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Indiana</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Among other provisions, HB 1001, Laws 2006, provided for a transition to a single-factor formula for tax years beginning after 2010. The sales factor will be weighted at 60% for 2007; 70% for 2008; 80% for 2009; 90% for 2010; and 100% starting in 2011. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>HB 859, Laws 2006, increased the corporate income tax sales-factor weighting from 60% to 70%.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>South Carolina</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>For tax years beginning after 2006, HB 4874, Laws 2006, provided a single-sales-factor apportionment for taxpayers whose principal business in the state is manufacturing or any form of collecting, buying, assembling or processing goods and materials within the state, or selling, distributing or dealing in tangible personal property within the state. Qualifying taxpayers can take advantage of any resulting tax savings on a phased-in basis for tax years 2007–2010, relative to their tax liabilities owed under the previous standard four-factor double-weighted sales-factor apportionment formula. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<h5 class=Blue>Apportionment Factors </h5>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Alabama </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>An administrative law judge (ALJ) ruled<sup><a href=\"#52\">52</a></sup> that an interstate pipeline company could include in its payroll factor compensation paid to a parent for personnel that performed operational and administrative functions for the company. The ALJ explained that the “payroll factor” statute does not require that compensation be paid to direct employees and can include amounts paid for “loaned” nonemployees that perform the same services as direct employees, because both contribute to income production. </p>\\r\\n<p>In another ruling, an ALJ held<sup><a href=\"#53\">53</a></sup> that a truck manufacturer had to source to Alabama (i.e., include in the numerator of the sales factor) sales from trucks/parts that were ultimately delivered to customers in the state, even though initial physical delivery and title passage occurred at its out-of-state facility, when third-party carriers retrieved the products on behalf of the Alabama customers.<strong></strong></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>California </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The most significant apportionment developments during 2006 were the California Supreme Court’s decisions addressing whether the entire gross proceeds generated by certain treasury activities should be included in the sales factor. The state supreme court affirmed<sup><a href=\"#54\">54</a></sup> the court of appeal to hold that the entire gross proceeds received by Microsoft Corp. on redemption of marketable securities at maturity constituted “gross receipts” under (1) the state’s definitional provisions, (2) the legislative history behind the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA) and (3) prior decisions of the State Board of Equalization (SBE). However, the court held that “in this instance,” the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) met its burden of proving by “clear and convincing evidence” that the standard apportionment formula did not fairly represent the extent of Microsoft’s business activity in California. Under the facts, Microsoft’s income from marketable securities constituted 2% of total income and 73% of gross receipts.</p>\\r\\n<p>Similarly, in <em>General Motors Corp.,</em><sup><a href=\"#55\">55</a></sup> the state supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part a court of appeal decision, remanding the case for further proceedings consistent with its <em>Microsoft </em>decision. Specifically, the state supreme court held that a repurchase agreement is more closely analogous to a secured loan than a sale for UDITPA purposes; thus, only the interest received under the agreement should be treated as a gross receipt. With regard to marketable securities held until maturity, the court stated that the conclusion in <em>Microsoft </em>applied equally to the marketable securities held to maturity by General Motors. Because neither the trial court nor the appeals court had occasion to address the FTB’s alternative apportionment- formula arguments, the state supreme court remanded the case for further proceedings, to allow the FTB to make this case.<em> </em>The court of appeal then remanded the case to the trial court for examination of the distortion issue. With respect to the application of the research credit issue in <em>General Motors,</em> the court held that only the taxpaying corporation that performed the research is entitled to the credit. <em></em></p>\\r\\nThe state supreme court declined to review two other “gross versus net sales factor” cases (Toys “R” Us, Inc.,<sup><a href=\"#56\">56</a></sup><em> </em>and <em>The Limited Stores, Inc.</em><sup><a href=\"#57\">57</a></sup>) that it had previously accepted and put on hold, sending them back to the courts of appeal with instructions to vacate their prior decisions and reconsider in light of the court’s recent rulings in <em>Microsoft </em>and <em>General Motors</em>.\\r\\n<p>In response to the <em>Microsoft </em>and <em>General Motors</em> decisions, FTB Notice 2006-3<sup><a href=\"#58\">58</a></sup> provides accuracy-related penalty protection for a taxpayer that reports in its sales factor only the interest income and net gains (and not gross receipts) from “the redemption of marketable securities as part of its treasury function.” </p>\\r\\n<p>In other sales-factor developments, the FTB issued two legal rulings. In the first,<sup><a href=\"#59\">59</a></sup> it explained how to calculate the apportionment formula for taxpayers that generate both taxable and exempt nonbusiness income, excluding activities that give rise to income not included in the tax base from the apportionment formula. In the second,<sup><a href=\"#60\">60</a></sup> the FTB explained how to assign receipts derived from sales of other than tangible personal property when a taxpayer-member of a combined reporting group pays another group member to perform activities related to the sale. The FTB stated:</p>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>[d]ue to the effects of combined reporting when the contractor and the subcontractor are in a unitary relationship and are members of the same combined reporting group, the activities of the subcontractor in performance of the contract will be considered income-producing activities <em>directly</em> engaged in by the contractor for purposes of the sales factor in order to more accurately assign the receipt to the place where the services were performed. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The FTB also proposed regulations section 25137-14, providing detailed rules on the apportionment of income earned by mutual fund service providers. In general, the proposed regulation addresses the types of services performed by these businesses and offers rules on the corresponding sales-factor assignment of receipts derived from these services. The proposed regulation adopts a shareholder-location sales factor, under which the sales factor is as-signed using a ratio of shares owned by shareholders in California to shares owned by shareholders located everywhere. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Idaho</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Amended Income Tax Rule 35.01.550 provides exceptions to the general rule that income-producing activity for purposes of the sales factor generally does not include transactions and activities performed on behalf of the taxpayer. The amendments provide that income-producing activity includes transactions and activities performed on behalf of a taxpayer when (1) the taxpayer sells its product exclusively through independent contractors; (2) the independent contractors can work only for the taxpayer; or (3) excluding the transactions and activities of the independent contractors would lead to an unreasonable result. The amendments also provide that only the direct costs paid by the taxpayer are considered.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Indiana </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR ruled that an in-state insurance company selling policies nationwide must source the receipts to Indiana for adjusted-gross-income-tax purposes based on its ratio of time spent performing such services in Indiana relative to everywhere.<sup><a href=\"#61\">61</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<p>The DOR also ruled<sup><a href=\"#62\">62</a></sup> that an out-of-state manufacturer was required to source to Indiana the sales of goods shipped from its out-of-state location to Indiana through customer-arranged common carrier, because the state adheres to the destination rule under statute, regardless of the ruling in <em>Miller Brewing Co.</em><sup><a href=\"#63\">63</a></sup></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Kentucky</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR issued amended rules<sup><a href=\"#64\">64</a></sup> addressing activities that result in the assignment of gross receipts to the state for purposes of the apportionment-formula sales factor; how to calculate the payroll and property factors; and apportionment and allocation for financial organizations and loan companies. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Louisiana</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR clarified<sup><a href=\"#65\">65</a></sup> that goods, merchandise or property imported from outside the U.S. and received in a Louisiana foreign-trade zone are deemed received outside of the state and are excluded from the numerator of the revenue ratio.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Maryland </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Amended Reg.

Based on this decision, the DOR explained<sup><a href=\"#67\">67</a></sup> that receipts from the sale of electricity will be sourced as “other than sales of tangible personal property,” and that this apportionment method will be applied to all tax years within the statute of limitations (SOL) for assessment or abatement.</p>\\r\\n<p>In another development, the DOR amended Reg. 830 CMR 63.38.7, regarding the sales-factor calculation for mutual fund sales corporations, to address the assignment of mutual fund sales to Massachusetts in related-party transactions.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Michigan </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The Department of Treasury (DOT) provided guidance and standardized its policy on the application of the “costs of performance” method as it pertains to the single-business-tax (SBT) sales factor.<sup><a href=\"#68\">68</a></sup> This guidance applies to the provision of services, the sale of intangible and real property and the rental of property.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>New Hampshire</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR readopted, with numerous amendments, rules that clarify definitions, apportionment and sales-factor sourcing as they relate to services for purposes of the state business-profits tax.<sup><a href=\"#69\">69</a></sup></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>New Jersey </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Amended rule NJAC 18:7-8.11 clarified that, if a trademark licensee is authorized to sell a trademarked product both in and outside the state, the licensor is considered to be using the product in New Jersey for apportionment purposes based on the same ratio as the licensee’s in-state revenue relative to revenue from all sources. </p>\\r\\n<p>In another development, an out-of-state company filed a lawsuit against the Division of Taxation, claiming that the sales-factor throw-out rule is unconstitutional.<sup><a href=\"#70\">70</a></sup></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Oregon </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The state tax court awarded a full refund for insurance excise taxes paid by an out-of-state insurance company, because income attributed to the state under the standard formula was “out of all appropriate proportion” to the business it transacted in Oregon, and neither the DOR nor the court had statutory authority to apply a discretionary alternative apportionment method to “insurance companies.”<sup><a href=\"#71\">71</a></sup></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Pennsylvania </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The state supreme court affirmed<sup><a href=\"#72\">72</a></sup> that a subsidiary without employees could not impute a payroll factor based on the use of affiliated-company employees or independent contractors, for either corporate franchise or net income tax purposes. The subsidiary had paid for the imputed services using intercompany accounts, booking these costs as payroll expenses.<strong></strong></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Texas </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Amended Rules 34 TAC 3.549 and 34 TAC 3.557 provide that, for reports due after April 20, 2006, receipts from the servicing of loans secured by real property are apportioned to the location of the real property that secures the loan being serviced.<strong> </strong>Membership or enrollment fees paid for access to benefits are receipts from the sale of an intangible asset and are apportioned to the payer’s legal domicile.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Virginia </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOT explained<sup><a href=\"#73\">73</a></sup> that, for corporate income tax purposes, capital gain from the sale of stock earned by an out-of-state-headquartered affiliate included in an in-state combined corporate income tax return should be sourced to Virginia for sales-factor purposes, because the affiliate’s income-producing activity resulting in the capital gain occurred in the state based on costs of performance. </p>\\r\\n<p>In another development, the DOT ruled<sup><a href=\"#74\">74</a></sup> that a perishable food-products manufacturer had to source sales ultimately shipped to out-of-state wholesaler distribution hubs or unrelated distribution centers to Virginia, because they were held at in-state refrigerated loading docks rented by the purchasers for two to three days prior to their ultimate transportation outside the state.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Wisconsin</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR adopted apportionment provisions for financial institutions, broker-dealers, investment advisers, investment companies and underwriters for tax years beginning in 2006.<sup><a href=\"#75\">75</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<p>In another development, the state tax appeals commission held<sup><a href=\"#76\">76</a></sup> that the sale of telephone directory advertising constitutes the sale of a service, rather than the sale of tangible personal property, because its purchasers are the advertising customers, not the directory recipients.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<h3>Filing Methods</h3>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Alabama</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>An ALJ held that a subsidiary serving as the central internal lender for AT&amp;T Corp. and its subsidiaries did not qualify as a financial institution subject to the financial institution excise tax, because it was not in competition with the business of national banks. Accordingly, because the lending subsidiary was part of AT&amp;T’s Alabama affiliated group for the years at issue, it had to be included in the state consolidated corporate income tax return.<sup><a href=\"#77\">77</a></sup><strong></strong></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Arizona</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>A DOR hearing officer ruled<sup><a href=\"#78\">78</a></sup> that a taxpayer was required to include four subsidiaries (a holding company, financing company, trademark company and real estate investment trust (REIT)) in its combined corporate income tax return, because the group was under common ownership and common management; had reconciled accounting systems; and exhibited substantial interdependence, integration and ties at its basic operational levels. In addition, the company could not claim a deduction for dividends received from the REIT, because such intercompany transactions had to be eliminated on the state combined income tax return. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>California </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>SB 663, Laws 2006, clarified that a controlled foreign corporation that is a California taxpayer or has effectively connected income (income earned in the U.S.) must include subpart F income in its water’s-edge income base.<sup><a href=\"#79\">79</a></sup></p>\\r\\n<p>In another development, the SBE ruled<sup><a href=\"#80\">80</a></sup> that a company filing state corporate franchise/income tax returns could not include insurance company subsidiaries in a state combined report, despite claims that their exclusion resulted in distortion of noninsurance-company income attributable to California sources.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Georgia</strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR adopted amended Rule 560-7-3-.13 on the filing of consolidated returns. </p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Idaho </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Although the taxpayers filed income tax returns on a water’s-edge basis, the state tax commission ruled<sup><a href=\"#81\">81</a></sup> that the election was barred, because the taxpayer had not filed water’s-edge election Form 14, Idaho’s Water’s Edge and Consent Form.</p>\\r\\n<p>In another decision, the state tax commission determined that for an insurance company to be excluded from a unitary combined group, it must pay a premiums tax to the state.<sup><a href=\"#82\">82</a></sup></p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Indiana </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The DOR ruled<sup><a href=\"#83\">83</a></sup> that a retailer was required to file a combined adjusted-gross-income tax return with its two wholly owned royalty and management subsidiaries, to better reflect its Indiana-source income.</p>\\r\\n<p>The DOR similarly ruled<sup><a href=\"#84\">84</a></sup> that a group of affiliate banks and credit card companies that were deemed to be operating as one interdependent unitary business was required to file a combined financial institutions tax return. </p>\\r\\n<p>The DOR also required<sup><a href=\"#85\">85</a></sup> a company to file a combined return with various affiliates that sold similar products or operated as procurement companies, to more fairly reflect the overall income earned in the state by the unitary business. </p>\\r\\n<p>In the legislative area, HB 1001, Laws 2006, required a corporation that files combined income tax returns to petition the DOR within 30 days after the end of the taxpayer’s tax year for permission to discontinue filing combined returns.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n    <li>\\r\\n    <p><strong>Kentucky </strong></p>\\r\\n    </li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>The court of appeals reversed the trial court to hold<sup><a href=\"#86\">86</a></sup> that 2000 legislation retroactively prohibiting refund claims based on unitary return filings for years prior to 1996 exceeded Constitutional limits and violated the taxpayers’ due process rights. Accordingly, the previous summary judgment in the DOR’s favor was reversed, and the case was remanded to determine whether, on its merits, the taxpayers were entitled to their pending refund claims.
